I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror. Damn my hair – it just won’t behave,

and damn Katherine Kavanagh for being ill and subjecting me to this ordeal. I should be

studying for my final exams, which are next week, yet here I am trying to brush my hair

into submission. I must not sleep with it wet. I must not sleep with it wet. Reciting this

mantra several times, I attempt, once more, to bring it under control with the brush. I roll

my eyes in exasperation and gaze at the pale, brown-haired girl with blue eyes too big for

her face staring back at me, and give up. My only option is to restrain my wayward hair in

a ponytail and hope that I look semi presentable.

Kate is my roommate, and she has chosen today of all days to succumb to the flu.

Therefore, she cannot attend the interview she’d arranged to do, with some mega-industri-

alist tycoon I’ve never heard of, for the student newspaper. So I have been volunteered. I

have final exams to cram for, one essay to finish, and I’m supposed to be working this af-

ternoon, but no – today I have to drive a hundred and sixty-five miles to downtown Seattle

in order to meet the enigmatic CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. As an exceptional

entrepreneur and major benefactor of our University, his time is extraordinarily precious

– much more precious than mine – but he has granted Kate an interview. A real coup, she

tells me. Damn her extra-curricular activities.

Kate is huddled on the couch in the living room.

“Ana, I’m sorry. It took me nine months to get this interview. It will take another

six to reschedule, and we’ll both have graduated by then. As the editor, I can’t blow this

off. Please,” Kate begs me in her rasping, sore throat voice. How does she do it? Even

ill she looks gamine and gorgeous, strawberry blonde hair in place and green eyes bright,

although now red-rimmed and runny. I ignore my pang of unwelcome sympathy.

“Of course I’ll go Kate. You should get back to bed. Would you like some Nyquil or

Tylenol?”

“Nyquil, please. Here are the questions and my mini-disc recorder. Just press record

here. Make notes, I’ll transcribe it all.”

“I know nothing about him,” I murmur, trying and failing to suppress my rising panic.

“The questions will see you through. Go. It’s a long drive. I don’t want you to be late.”

“Okay, I’m going. Get back to bed. I made you some soup to heat up later.” I stare at

her fondly. Only for you, Kate, would I do this.

“I will. Good luck. And thanks Ana – as usual, you’re my lifesaver.”

Gathering my satchel, I smile wryly at her, then head out the door to the car. I can-

not believe I have let Kate talk me into this. But then Kate can talk anyone into anything.

She’ll make an exceptional journalist. She’s articulate, strong, persuasive, argumentative,

beautiful – and she’s my dearest, dearest friend.

The roads are clear as I set off from Vancouver, WA toward Portland and the I-5. It’s early,

and I don’t have to be in Seattle until two this afternoon. Fortunately, Kate’s lent me her

sporty Mercedes CLK. I’m not sure Wanda, my old VW Beetle, would make the journey in

time. Oh, the Merc is a fun drive, and the miles slip away as I floor the pedal to the metal.

My destination is the headquarters of Mr. Grey’s global enterprise. It’s a huge twenty-

story office building, all curved glass and steel, an architect’s utilitarian fantasy, with Grey

House written discreetly in steel over the glass front doors. It’s a quarter to two when I

arrive, greatly relieved that I’m not late as I walk into the enormous – and frankly intimi-

dating – glass, steel, and white sandstone lobby.

Behind the solid sandstone desk, a very attractive, groomed, blonde young woman

smiles pleasantly at me. She’s wearing the sharpest charcoal suit jacket and white shirt I

have ever seen. She looks immaculate.

“I’m here to see Mr. Grey. Anastasia Steele for Katherine Kavanagh.”

“Excuse me one moment, Miss Steele.” She arches her eyebrow slightly as I stand self-

consciously before her. I am beginning to wish I’d borrowed one of Kate’s formal blazers

rather than wear my navy blue jacket. I have made an effort and worn my one and only

skirt, my sensible brown knee-length boots and a blue sweater. For me, this is smart. I tuck

one of the escaped tendrils of my hair behind my ear as I pretend she doesn’t intimidate me.

“Miss Kavanagh is expected. Please sign in here, Miss Steele. You’ll want the last

elevator on the right, press for the twentieth floor.” She smiles kindly at me, amused no

doubt, as I sign in.

She hands me a security pass that has VISITOR very firmly stamped on the front. I

can’t help my smirk. Surely it’s obvious that I’m just visiting. I don’t fit in here at all.

Nothing changes, I inwardly sigh. Thanking her, I walk over to the bank of elevators past

the two security men who are both far more smartly dressed than I am in their well-cut

black suits.

The elevator whisks me with terminal velocity to the twentieth floor. The doors slide

open, and I’m in another large lobby – again all glass, steel, and white sandstone. I’m

confronted by another desk of sandstone and another young blonde woman dressed impec-

cably in black and white who rises to greet me.

“Miss Steele, could you wait here, please?” She points to a seated area of white leather

chairs.

Behind the leather chairs is a spacious glass-walled meeting room with an equally spa-

cious dark wood table and at least twenty matching chairs around it. Beyond that, there is

a floor-to-ceiling window with a view of the Seattle skyline that looks out through the city

toward the Sound. It’s a stunning vista, and I’m momentarily paralyzed by the view. Wow.

I sit down, fish the questions from my satchel, and go through them, inwardly curs-

ing Kate for not providing me with a brief biography. I know nothing about this man I’m

about to interview. He could be ninety or he could be thirty. The uncertainty is galling,

and my nerves resurface, making me fidget. I’ve never been comfortable with one-on-one

interviews, preferring the anonymity of a group discussion where I can sit inconspicuously

at the back of the room. To be honest, I prefer my own company, reading a classic British

novel, curled up in a chair in the campus library. Not sitting twitching nervously in a colos-

sal glass and stone edifice.

I roll my eyes at myself. Get a grip, Steele. Judging from the building, which is too

clinical and modern, I guess Grey is in his forties: fit, tanned, and fair-haired to match the

rest of the personnel.

Another elegant, flawlessly dressed blonde comes out of a large door to the right. What

is it with all the immaculate blondes? It’s like Stepford here. Taking a deep breath, I stand

up. “Miss Steele?” the latest blonde asks.

“Yes,” I croak, and clear my throat. “Yes.” There, that sounded more confident.

“Mr. Grey will see you in a moment. May I take your jacket?”

“Oh please.” I struggle out of the jacket.

“Have you been offered any refreshment?”

“Um – no.” Oh dear, is Blonde Number One in trouble?

Blonde Number Two frowns and eyes the young woman at the desk.

“Would you like tea, coffee, water?” she asks, turning her attention back to me.

“A glass of water. Thank you,” I murmur.

“Olivia, please fetch Miss Steele a glass of water.” Her voice is stern. Olivia scoots up

immediately and scurries to a door on the other side of the foyer.

“My apologies, Miss Steele, Olivia is our new intern. Please be seated. Mr. Grey will

be another five minutes.”

Olivia returns with a glass of iced water.

“Here you go, Miss Steele.”

“Thank you.”

Blonde Number Two marches over to the large desk, her heels clicking and echoing on

the sandstone floor. She sits down, and they both continue their work.

Perhaps Mr. Grey insists on all his employees being blonde. I’m wondering idly if

that’s legal, when the office door opens and a tall, elegantly dressed, attractive African-

American man with short dreads exits. I have definitely worn the wrong clothes.

He turns and says through the door. “Golf, this week, Grey.”

I don’t hear the reply. He turns, sees me, and smiles, his dark eyes crinkling at the

corners. Olivia has jumped up and called the elevator. She seems to excel at jumping from

her seat. She’s more nervous than me!

“Good afternoon ladies,” he says as he departs through the sliding door.

“Mr. Grey will see you now, Miss Steele. Do go through,” Blonde Number Two says.

I stand rather shakily trying to suppress my nerves. Gathering up my satchel, I abandon my

glass of water and make my way to the partially open door.

“You don’t need to knock – just go in.” She smiles kindly.

I push open the door and stumble through, tripping over my own feet, and falling head

first into the office.

Double crap – me and my two left feet! I am on my hands and knees in the doorway

to Mr. Grey’s office, and gentle hands are around me helping me to stand. I am so em-

barrassed, damn my clumsiness. I have to steel myself to glance up. Holy cow – he’s so

young.

“Miss Kavanagh.” He extends a long-fingered hand to me once I’m upright. “I’m

Christian Grey. Are you all right? Would you like to sit?”

So young – and attractive, very attractive. He’s tall, dressed in a fine gray suit, white

shirt, and black tie with unruly dark copper colored hair and intense, bright gray eyes that

regard me shrewdly. It takes a moment for me to find my voice.

“Um. Actually–” I mutter. If this guy is over thirty then I’m a monkey’s uncle. In a

daze, I place my hand in his and we shake. As our fingers touch, I feel an odd exhilarating

shiver run through me. I withdraw my hand hastily, embarrassed. Must be static. I blink

rapidly, my eyelids matching my heart rate.

“Miss Kavanagh is indisposed, so she sent me. I hope you don’t mind, Mr. Grey.”

“And you are?” His voice is warm, possibly amused, but it’s difficult to tell from his

impassive expression. He looks mildly interested, but above all, polite.

“Anastasia Steele. I’m studying English Literature with Kate, um… Katherine…

um… Miss Kavanagh at Washington State.”

“I see,” he says simply. I think I see the ghost of a smile in his expression, but I’m not

sure. “Would you like to sit?” He waves me toward a white leather buttoned L-shaped couch.

His office is way too big for just one man. In front of the floor-to-ceiling windows,

there’s a huge modern dark-wood desk that six people could comfortably eat around. It

matches the coffee table by the couch. Everything else is white – ceiling, floors, and walls

except, on the wall by the door, where a mosaic of small paintings hang, thirty-six of them

arranged in a square. They are exquisite – a series of mundane, forgotten objects painted in

such precise detail they look like photographs. Displayed together, they are breathtaking.

“A local artist. Trouton,” says Grey when he catches my gaze.

“They’re lovely. Raising the ordinary to extraordinary,” I murmur, distracted both by

him and the paintings. He cocks his head to one side and regards me intently.

“I couldn’t agree more, Miss Steele,” he replies, his voice soft and for some inexpli-

cable reason I find myself blushing.

Apart from the paintings, the rest of the office is cold, clean, and clinical. I wonder if

it reflects the personality of the Adonis who sinks gracefully into one of the white leather

chairs opposite me. I shake my head, disturbed at the direction of my thoughts, and retrieve

Kate’s questions from my satchel. Next, I set up the mini-disc recorder and am all fingers

and thumbs, dropping it twice on the coffee table in front of me. Mr. Grey says nothing,

waiting patiently – I hope – as I become increasingly embarrassed and flustered. When I

pluck up the courage to look at him, he’s watching me, one hand relaxed in his lap and the

other cupping his chin and trailing his long index finger across his lips. I think he’s trying

to suppress a smile.

“Sorry,” I stutter. “I’m not used to this.”

“Take all the time you need, Miss Steele,” he says.

“Do you mind if I record your answers?”

“After you’ve taken so much trouble to set up the recorder – you ask me now?”

I flush. He’s teasing me? I hope. I blink at him, unsure what to say, and I think he

takes pity on me because he relents. “No, I don’t mind.”

“Did Kate, I mean, Miss Kavanagh, explain what the interview was for?”

“Yes. To appear in the graduation issue of the student newspaper as I shall be confer-

ring the degrees at this year’s graduation ceremony.”

Oh! This is news to me, and I’m temporarily pre-occupied by the thought that some-

one not much older than me – okay, maybe six years or so, and okay, mega successful, but

still – is going to present me with my degree. I frown, dragging my wayward attention

back to the task at hand.

“Good,” I swallow nervously. “I have some questions, Mr. Grey.” I smooth a stray

lock of hair behind my ear.

“I thought you might,” he says, deadpan. He’s laughing at me. My cheeks heat at the

realization, and I sit up and square my shoulders in an attempt to look taller and more in-

timidating. Pressing the start button on the recorder, I try to look professional.

“You’re very young to have amassed such an empire. To what do you owe your suc-

cess?” I glance up at him. His smile is rueful, but he looks vaguely disappointed.

“Business is all about people, Miss Steele, and I’m very good at judging people. I

know how they tick, what makes them flourish, what doesn’t, what inspires them, and how

to incentivize them. I employ an exceptional team, and I reward them well.” He pauses

and fixes me with his gray stare. “My belief is to achieve success in any scheme one has

to make oneself master of that scheme, know it inside and out, know every detail. I work

hard, very hard to do that. I make decisions based on logic and facts. I have a natural gut

instinct that can spot and nurture a good solid idea and good people. The bottom line is,

it’s always down to good people.”

“Maybe you’re just lucky.” This isn’t on Kate’s list – but he’s so arrogant. His eyes

flare momentarily in surprise.

“I don’t subscribe to luck or chance, Miss Steele. The harder I work the more luck I

seem to have. It really is all about having the right people on your team and directing their

energies accordingly. I think it was Harvey Firestone who said ‘the growth and develop-

ment of people is the highest calling of leadership.’”

“You sound like a control freak.” The words are out of my mouth before I can stop

them.“Oh, I exercise control in all things, Miss Steele,” he says without a trace of humor in

his smile. I look at him, and he holds my gaze steadily, impassive. My heartbeat quickens,

and my face flushes again.

Why does he have such an unnerving effect on me? His overwhelming good-looks

maybe? The way his eyes blaze at me? The way he strokes his index finger against his

lower lip? I wish he’d stop doing that.

“Besides, immense power is acquired by assuring yourself in your secret reveries that

you were born to control things,” he continues, his voice soft.

“Do you feel that you have immense power?” Control Freak.

“I employ over forty thousand people, Miss Steele. That gives me a certain sense of

responsibility – power, if you will. If I were to decide I was no longer interested in the

telecommunications business and sell up, twenty thousand people would struggle to make

their mortgage payments after a month or so.”

My mouth drops open. I am staggered by his lack of humility.

“Don’t you have a board to answer to?” I ask, disgusted.

“I own my company. I don’t have to answer to a board.” He raises an eyebrow at me.

I flush. Of course, I would know this if I had done some research. But holy crap, he’s so

arrogant. I change tack.

“And do you have any interests outside your work?”

“I have varied interests, Miss Steele.” A ghost of a smile touches his lips. “Very var-

ied.” And for some reason, I’m confounded and heated by his steady gaze. His eyes are

alight with some wicked thought.

“But if you work so hard, what do you do to chill out?”

“Chill out?” He smiles, revealing perfect white teeth. I stop breathing. He really is

beautiful. No one should be this good-looking.

“Well, to ‘chill out’ as you put it – I sail, I fly, I indulge in various physical pursuits.”

He shifts in his chair. “I’m a very wealthy man, Miss Steele, and I have expensive and

absorbing hobbies.”

I glance quickly at Kate’s questions, wanting to get off this subject.

“You invest in manufacturing. Why, specifically?” I ask. Why does he make me so

uncomfortable?

“I like to build things. I like to know how things work: what makes things tick, how to

construct and deconstruct. And I have a love of ships. What can I say?”

“That sounds like your heart talking rather than logic and facts.”

His mouth quirks up, and he stares appraisingly at me.

“Possibly. Though there are people who’d say I don’t have a heart.”

“Why would they say that?”

“Because they know me well.” His lip curls in a wry smile.

“Would your friends say you’re easy to get to know?” And I regret the question as soon

as I say it. It’s not on Kate’s list.

“I’m a very private person, Miss Steele. I go a long way to protect my privacy. I don’t

often give interviews,” he trails off.

“Why did you agree to do this one?”

“Because I’m a benefactor of the University, and for all intents and purposes, I couldn’t

get Miss Kavanagh off my back. She badgered and badgered my PR people, and I admire

that kind of tenacity.”

I know how tenacious Kate can be. That’s why I’m sitting here squirming uncomfort-

ably under his penetrating gaze, when I should be studying for my exams.

“You also invest in farming technologies. Why are you interested in this area?”

“We can’t eat money, Miss Steele, and there are too many people on this planet who

don’t have enough to eat.”

“That sounds very philanthropic. Is it something you feel passionately about? Feeding

the world’s poor?”

He shrugs, very non-committal.

“It’s shrewd business,” he murmurs, though I think he’s being disingenuous. It doesn’t

make sense – feeding the world’s poor? I can’t see the financial benefits of this, only the

virtue of the ideal. I glance at the next question, confused by his attitude.

“Do you have a philosophy? If so, what is it?”

“I don’t have a philosophy as such. Maybe a guiding principle – Carnegie’s: ‘A man

who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of

anything else to which he is justly entitled.’ I’m very singular, driven. I like control – of

myself and those around me.”

“So you want to possess things?” You are a control freak.

“I want to deserve to possess them, but yes, bottom line, I do.”

“You sound like the ultimate consumer.”

“I am.” He smiles, but the smile doesn’t touch his eyes. Again this is at odds with

someone who wants to feed the world, so I can’t help thinking that we’re talking about

something else, but I’m absolutely mystified as to what it is. I swallow hard. The tempera-

ture in the room is rising or maybe it’s just me. I just want this interview to be over. Surely

Kate has enough material now? I glance at the next question.

“You were adopted. How far do you think that’s shaped the way you are?” Oh, this is

personal. I stare at him, hoping he’s not offended. His brow furrows.

“I have no way of knowing.”

My interest is piqued.

“How old were you when you were adopted?”

“That’s a matter of public record, Miss Steele.” His tone is stern. I flush, again. Crap.

Yes of course – if I’d known I was doing this interview, I would have done some research.

I move on quickly.

“You’ve had to sacrifice a family life for your work.”

“That’s not a question.” He’s terse.

“Sorry.” I squirm, and he’s made me feel like an errant child. I try again. “Have you

had to sacrifice a family life for your work?”

“I have a family. I have a brother and a sister and two loving parents. I’m not inter-

ested in extending my family beyond that.”

“Are you gay, Mr. Grey?”

He inhales sharply, and I cringe, mortified. Crap. Why didn’t I employ some kind

of filter before I read this straight out? How can I tell him I’m just reading the questions?

Damn Kate and her curiosity!

“No Anastasia, I’m not.” He raises his eyebrows, a cool gleam in his eyes. He does

not look pleased.

“I apologize. It’s um… written here.” It’s the first time he’s said my name. My heart-

beat has accelerated, and my cheeks are heating up again. Nervously, I tuck my loosened

hair behind my ear.

He cocks his head to one side.

“These aren’t your own questions?”

The blood drains from my head. Oh no.

“Err… no. Kate – Miss Kavanagh – she compiled the questions.”

“Are you colleagues on the student paper?” Oh crap. I have nothing to do with the

student paper. It’s her extra-curricular activity, not mine. My face is aflame.

“No. She’s my roommate.”

He rubs his chin in quiet deliberation, his gray eyes appraising me.

“Did you volunteer to do this interview?” he asks, his voice deadly quiet.

Hang on, who’s supposed to be interviewing whom? His eyes burn into me, and I’m

compelled to answer with the truth.

“I was drafted. She’s not well.” My voice is weak and apologetic.

“That explains a great deal.”

There’s a knock at the door, and Blonde Number Two enters.

“Mr. Grey, forgive me for interrupting, but your next meeting is in two minutes.”

“We’re not finished here, Andrea. Please cancel my next meeting.”

Andrea hesitates, gaping at him. She’s appears lost. He turns his head slowly to face

her and raises his eyebrows. She flushes bright pink. Oh good. It’s not just me.

“Very well, Mr. Grey,” she mutters, then exits. He frowns, and turns his attention back

to me.

“Where were we, Miss Steele?”

Oh, we’re back to ‘Miss Steele’ now.

“Please don’t let me keep you from anything.”

“I want to know about you. I think that’s only fair.” His gray eyes are alight with cu-

riosity. Double crap. Where’s he going with this? He places his elbows on the arms of

the chair and steeples his fingers in front of his mouth. His mouth is very… distracting. I

swallow.

“There’s not much to know,” I say, flushing again.

“What are your plans after you graduate?”

I shrug, thrown by his interest. Come to Seattle with Kate, find a place, find a job. I

haven’t really thought beyond my finals.

“I haven’t made any plans, Mr. Grey. I just need to get through my final exams.”

Which I should be studying for now rather than sitting in your palatial, swanky, sterile of-

fice, feeling uncomfortable under your penetrating gaze.

“We run an excellent internship program here,” he says quietly. I raise my eyebrows

in surprise. Is he offering me a job?

“Oh. I’ll bear that in mind,” I murmur, completely confounded. “Though I’m not sure

I’d fit in here.” Oh no. I’m musing out loud again.

“Why do you say that?” He cocks his head to one side, intrigued, a hint of a smile

playing on his lips.

“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” I’m uncoordinated, scruffy, and I’m not blonde.

“Not to me,” he murmurs. His gaze is intense, all humor gone, and strange muscles

deep in my belly clench suddenly. I tear my eyes away from his scrutiny and stare blindly

down at my knotted fingers. What’s going on? I have to go – now. I lean forward to re-

trieve the recorder.

“Would you like me to show you around?” he asks.

“I’m sure you’re far too busy, Mr. Grey, and I do have a long drive.”

“You’re driving back to WSU in Vancouver?” He sounds surprised, anxious even. He

glances out of the window. It’s begun to rain. “Well, you’d better drive carefully.” His tone

is stern, authoritative. Why should he care? “Did you get everything you need?” he adds.

“Yes sir,” I reply, packing the recorder into my satchel. His eyes narrow, speculatively.

“Thank you for the interview, Mr. Grey.”

“The pleasure’s been all mine,” he says, polite as ever.

As I rise, he stands and holds out his hand.

“Until we meet again, Miss Steele.” And it sounds like a challenge, or a threat, I’m

not sure which. I frown. When will we ever meet again? I shake his hand once more,

astounded that that odd current between us is still there. It must be my nerves.

“Mr. Grey.” I nod at him. Moving with lithe athletic grace to the door, he opens it wide.

“Just ensuring you make it through the door, Miss Steele.” He gives me a small smile.

Obviously, he’s referring to my earlier less-than-elegant entry into his office. I flush.

“That’s very considerate, Mr. Grey,” I snap, and his smile widens. I’m glad you find

me entertaining, I glower inwardly, walking into the foyer. I’m surprised when he follows

me out. Andrea and Olivia both look up, equally surprised.

“Did you have a coat?” Grey asks.

“Yes.” Olivia leaps up and retrieves my jacket, which Grey takes from her before she

can hand it to me. He holds it up and, feeling ridiculously self-conscious, I shrug it on.

Grey places his hands for a moment on my shoulders. I gasp at the contact. If he notices

my reaction, he gives nothing away. His long index finger presses the button summoning

the elevator, and we stand waiting – awkwardly on my part, coolly self-possessed on his.

The doors open, and I hurry in desperate to escape. I really need to get out of here. When

I turn to look at him, he’s leaning against the doorway beside the elevator with one hand

on the wall. He really is very, very good-looking. It’s distracting. His burning gray eyes

gaze at me.

“Anastasia,” he says as a farewell.

“Christian,” I reply. And mercifully, the doors close.



My heart is pounding. The elevator arrives on the first floor, and I scramble out as soon as

the doors slide open, stumbling once, but fortunately not sprawling on to the immaculate

sandstone floor. I race for the wide glass doors, and I’m free in the bracing, cleansing,

damp air of Seattle. Raising my face, I welcome the cool refreshing rain. I close my eyes

and take a deep, purifying breath, trying to recover what’s left of my equilibrium.

No man has ever affected me the way Christian Grey has, and I cannot fathom why.

Is it his looks? His civility? Wealth? Power? I don’t understand my irrational reaction.

I breathe an enormous sigh of relief. What in heaven’s name was that all about? Leaning

against one of the steel pillars of the building, I valiantly attempt to calm down and gather

my thoughts. I shake my head. Holy crap – what was that? My heart steadies to its regular

rhythm, and I can breathe normally again. I head for the car.

As I leave the city limits behind, I begin to feel foolish and embarrassed as I replay the

interview in my mind. Surely, I’m over-reacting to something that’s imaginary. Okay, so

he’s very attractive, confident, commanding, at ease with himself – but on the flip side, he’s

arrogant, and for all his impeccable manners, he’s autocratic and cold. Well, on the surface.

An involuntary shiver runs down my spine. He may be arrogant, but then he has a right to

be – he’s accomplished so much at such a young age. He doesn’t suffer fools gladly, but

why should he? Again, I’m irritated that Kate didn’t give me a brief biography.

While cruising along the I-5, my mind continues to wander. I’m truly perplexed as to

what makes someone so driven to succeed. Some of his answers were so cryptic – as if

he had a hidden agenda. And Kate’s questions – ugh! The adoption and asking him if he

was gay! I shudder. I can’t believe I said that. Ground, swallow me up now! Every time

I think of that question in the future, I will cringe with embarrassment. Damn Katherine

Kavanagh!

I check the speedometer. I’m driving more cautiously than I would on any other occa-

sion. And I know it’s the memory of two penetrating gray eyes gazing at me, and a stern

voice telling me to drive carefully. Shaking my head, I realize that Grey’s more like a man

double his age.

Forget it, Ana, I scold myself. I decide that all in all, it’s been a very interesting expe-

rience, but I shouldn’t dwell on it . Put it behind you. I never have to see him again. I’m

immediately cheered by the thought. I switch on the MP3 player and turn the volume up

loud, sit back, and listen to thumping indie rock music as I press down on the accelerator.

As I hit the 1-5, I realize I can drive as fast as I want.

We live in a small community of duplex apartments in Vancouver, Washington, close to the

Vancouver campus of WSU. I’m lucky – Kate’s parents bought the place for her, and I pay

peanuts for rent. It’s been home for four years now. As I pull up outside, I know Kate is go-

ing to want a blow-by-blow account, and she is tenacious. Well, at least she has the mini-

disc. Hopefully I won’t have to elaborate much beyond what was said during the interview.

“Ana! You’re back.” Kate sits in our living area, surrounded by books. She’s clearly

been studying for finals – though she’s still in her pink flannel pajamas decorated with cute

little rabbits, the ones she reserves for the aftermath of breaking up with boyfriends, for

assorted illnesses, and for general moody depression. She bounds up to me and hugs me

hard.

“I was beginning to worry. I expected you back sooner.”

“Oh, I thought I made good time considering the interview ran over.” I wave the mini-

disc recorder at her.

“Ana, thank you so much for doing this. I owe you, I know. How was it? What was

he like?” Oh no – here we go, the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition.

I struggle to answer her question. What can I say?

“I’m glad it’s over, and I don’t have to see him again. He was rather intimidating, you

know.” I shrug. “He’s very focused, intense even – and young. Really young.”

Kate gazes innocently at me. I frown at her.

“Don’t you look so innocent. Why didn’t you give me a biography? He made me feel

like such an idiot for skimping on basic research.” Kate clamps a hand to her mouth.

“Jeez, Ana, I’m sorry – I didn’t think.”

I huff.

“Mostly he was courteous, formal, slightly stuffy – like he’s old before his time. He

doesn’t talk like a man of twenty-something. How old is he anyway?”

“Twenty-seven. Jeez, Ana, I’m sorry. I should have briefed you, but I was in such a

panic. Let me have the mini-disc, and I’ll start transcribing the interview.”

“You look better. Did you eat your soup?” I ask, keen to change the subject.

“Yes, and it was delicious as usual. I’m feeling much better.” She smiles at me in grati-

tude. I check my watch.

“I have to run. I can still make my shift at Clayton’s.”

“Ana, you’ll be exhausted.”

“I’ll be fine. I’ll see you later.”

I’ve worked at Clayton’s since I started at WSU. It’s the largest independent hardware

store in the Portland area, and over the four years I’ve worked here, I’ve come to know a

little bit about most everything we sell – although ironically, I’m crap at any DIY. I leave

all that to my dad. I’m much more of a curl-up-with-a-book-in-a-comfy-chair-by-the-fire

kind of girl. I’m glad I can make my shift as it gives me something to focus on that isn’t

Christian Grey. We’re busy – it’s the start of the summer season, and folks are redecorating

their homes. Mrs. Clayton is pleased to see me.

“Ana! I thought you weren’t going to make it today.”

“My appointment didn’t take as long as I thought. I can do a couple of hours.”

“I’m real pleased to see you.”

She sends me to the storeroom to start re-stocking shelves, and I’m soon absorbed in

the task.

When I arrive home later, Katherine is wearing headphones and working on her laptop.

Her nose is still pink, but she has her teeth into a story, so she’s concentrating and typing

furiously. I’m thoroughly drained – exhausted by the long drive, the grueling interview,

and by being rushed off my feet at Clayton’s. I slump on to the couch, thinking about the

essay I have to finish and all the studying I haven’t done today because I was holed up

with … him.

“You’ve got some good stuff here, Ana. Well done. I can’t believe you didn’t take him

up on his offer to show you around. He obviously wanted to spend more time with you.”

She gives me a fleeting quizzical look.

I flush, and my heart rate inexplicably increases. That wasn’t the reason, surely? He

just wanted to show me around so I could see that he was lord of all he surveyed. I realize

I’m biting my lip, and I hope Kate doesn’t notice. But she seems absorbed in her transcrip-

tion.“I hear what you mean about formal. Did you take any notes?” she asks.

“Um… no, I didn’t.”

“That’s fine. I can still make a fine article with this. Shame we don’t have some origi-

nal stills. Good-looking son of a bitch, isn’t he?”

I flush.

“I suppose so.” I try hard to sound disinterested, and I think I succeed.

“Oh come on, Ana – even you can’t be immune to his looks.” She arches a perfect

eyebrow at me.

Crap! I distract her with flattery, always a good ploy.

“You probably would have got a lot more out of him.”

“I doubt that, Ana. Come on – he practically offered you a job. Given that I foisted this

on you at the last minute, you did very well.” She glances up at me speculatively. I make

a hasty retreat into the kitchen.

“So what did you really think of him?” Damn, she’s inquisitive. Why can’t she just let

this go? Think of something – quick.

“He’s very driven, controlling, arrogant – scary really, but very charismatic. I can un-

derstand the fascination,” I add truthfully, as I peer round the door at her hoping this will

shut her up once and for all.

“You, fascinated by a man? That’s a first,” she snorts.

I start gathering the makings of a sandwich so she can’t see my face.

“Why did you want to know if he was gay? Incidentally, that was the most embarrass-

ing question. I was mortified, and he was pissed to be asked too.” I scowl at the memory.

“Whenever he’s in the society pages, he never has a date.”

“It was embarrassing. The whole thing was embarrassing. I’m glad I’ll never have to

lay eyes on him again.”

“Oh, Ana, it can’t have been that bad. I think he sounds quite taken with you.”

Taken with me? Now Kate’s being ridiculous.

“Would you like a sandwich?”

“Please.”

We talk no more of Christian Grey that evening, much to my relief. Once we’ve eaten,

I’m able to sit at the dining table with Kate and, while she works on her article, I work on

my essay on Tess of the D’Urbervilles. Damn, but that woman was in the wrong place at

the wrong time in the wrong century. By the time I finish, it’s midnight, and Kate has long

since gone to bed. I make my way to my room, exhausted, but pleased that I’ve accom-

plished so much for a Monday.

I curl up in my white iron bed, wrapping my mother’s quilt around me, close my eyes,

and I’m instantly asleep. That night I dream of dark places, bleak white cold floors, and

gray eyes.

For the rest of the week, I throw myself into my studies and my job at Clayton’s. Kate is

busy too, compiling her last edition of her student magazine before she has to relinquish

it to the new editor while also cramming for her finals. By Wednesday, she’s much better,

and I no longer have to endure the sight of her pink-flannel-with-too-many-rabbits PJs. I

call my mom in Georgia to check on her, but also so she can wish me luck for my final ex-

ams. She proceeds to tell me about her latest venture into candle making – my mother is all

about new business ventures. Fundamentally she’s bored and wants something to occupy

her time, but she has the attention span of a goldfish. It’ll be something new next week.

She worries me. I hope she hasn’t mortgaged the house to finance this latest scheme. And I

hope that Bob – her relatively new but much older husband – is keeping an eye on her now

that I’m no longer there. He does seem a lot more grounded than Husband Number Three.

“How are things with you, Ana?”

For a moment, I hesitate, and I have Mom’s full attention.

“I’m fine.”

“Ana? Have you met someone?” Wow… how does she do that? The excitement in her

voice is palpable.

“No, Mom, it’s nothing. You’ll be the first to know if I do.”

“Ana, you really need to get out more, honey. You worry me.”

“Mom, I’m fine. How’s Bob?” As ever, distraction is the best policy.

Later that evening, I call Ray, my stepdad, Mom’s Husband Number Two, the man I

consider my father, and the man whose name I bear. It’s a brief conversation. In fact, it’s

not so much a conversation as a one-sided series of grunts in response to my gentle coax-

ing. Ray is not a talker. But he’s still alive, he’s still watching soccer on TV, and going

bowling and fly-fishing or making furniture when he’s not. Ray is a skilled carpenter and

the reason I know the difference between a hawk and a handsaw. All seems well with him.

Friday night, Kate and I are debating what to do with our evening – we want some time out

from our studies, from our work, and from student newspapers – when the doorbell rings.

Standing on our doorstep is my good friend José, clutching a bottle of champagne.

“José! Great to see you!” I give him a quick hug. “Come in.”

José is the first person I met when I arrived at WSU, looking as lost and lonely as I did.

We recognized a kindred spirit in each of us that day, and we’ve been friends ever since.

Not only do we share a sense of humor, but we discovered that both Ray and José Senior

were in the same army unit together. As a result, our fathers have become firm friends too.

José is studying engineering and is the first in his family to make it to college. He’s

pretty damn bright, but his real passion is photography. José has a great eye for a good

picture.

“I have news.” He grins, his dark eyes twinkling.

“Don’t tell me – you’ve managed not to get kicked out for another week,” I tease, and

he scowls playfully at me.

“The Portland Place Gallery is going to exhibit my photos next month.”

“That’s amazing – congratulations!” Delighted for him, I hug him again. Kate beams

at him too.

“Way to go José! I should put this in the paper. Nothing like last minute editorial

changes on a Friday evening.” She grins.

“Let’s celebrate. I want you to come to the opening.” José looks intently at me. I flush.

“Both of you, of course,” he adds, glancing nervously at Kate.

José and I are good friends, but I know deep down inside, he’d like to be more. He’s

cute and funny, but he’s just not for me. He’s more like the brother I never had. Katherine

often teases me that I’m missing the need-a-boyfriend gene, but the truth is – I just haven’t

met anyone who… well, whom I’m attracted to, even though part of me longs for those

trembling knees, heart-in-my-mouth, butterflies-in-my-belly, sleepless nights.

Sometimes I wonder if there’s something wrong with me. Perhaps I’ve spent too long

in the company of my literary romantic heroes, and consequently my ideals and expecta-

tions are far too high. But in reality, nobody’s ever made me feel like that.

Until very recently, the unwelcome, still small voice of my subconscious whispers.

NO! I banish the thought immediately. I am not going there, not after that painful inter-

view. Are you gay, Mr. Grey? I wince at the memory. I know I’ve dreamt about him most

nights since then, but that’s just to purge the awful experience from my system, surely?

I watch José open the bottle of champagne. He’s tall, and in his jeans and t-shirt he’s

all shoulders and muscles, tanned skin, dark hair and burning dark eyes. Yes, José’s pretty

hot, but I think he’s finally getting the message: we’re just friends. The cork makes its loud

pop, and José looks up and smiles.

Saturday at the store is a nightmare. We are besieged by do-it-yourselfers wanting to

spruce up their homes. Mr. and Mrs. Clayton, John and Patrick – the two other part-timers

– and I are all rushed off our feet. But there’s a lull around lunchtime, and Mrs. Clayton

asks me to check on some orders while I’m sitting behind the counter at the till discreetly

eating my bagel. I’m engrossed in the task, checking catalogue numbers against the items

we need and the items we’ve ordered, eyes flicking from the order book to the computer

screen and back as I check the entries match. Then, for some reason, I glance up… and

find myself locked in the bold gray gaze of Christian Grey who’s standing at the counter,

staring at me intently.

Heart failure.

“Miss Steele. What a pleasant surprise.” His gaze is unwavering and intense.

Holy crap. What the hell is he doing here looking all tousled-hair and outdoorsy in his

cream chunky-knit sweater, jeans, and walking boots? I think my mouth has popped open,

and I can’t locate my brain or my voice.

“Mr. Grey,” I whisper, because that’s all I can manage. There’s a ghost of a smile on

his lips and his eyes are alight with humor, as if he’s enjoying some private joke.

“I was in the area,” he says by way of explanation. “I need to stock up on a few things.

It’s a pleasure to see you again, Miss Steele.” His voice is warm and husky like dark

melted chocolate fudge caramel… or something.

I shake my head to gather my wits. My heart is pounding a frantic tattoo, and for

some reason I’m blushing furiously under his steady scrutiny. I am utterly thrown by the

sight of him standing before me. My memories of him did not do him justice. He’s not

merely good-looking – he’s the epitome of male beauty, breathtaking, and he’s here. Here

in Clayton’s Hardware Store. Go figure. Finally my cognitive functions are restored and

reconnected with the rest of my body.

“Ana. My name’s Ana,” I mutter. “What can I help you with, Mr. Grey?”

He smiles, and again it’s like he’s privy to some big secret. It is so disconcerting. Tak-

ing a deep breath, I put on my professional I’ve-worked-in-this-shop-for-years façade. I

can do this.

“There are a few items I need. To start with, I’d like some cable ties,” he murmurs, his

gray eyes cool but amused.

Cable ties?

“We stock various lengths. Shall I show you?” I mutter, my voice soft and wavery.

Get a grip, Steele. A slight frown mars Grey’s rather lovely brow.

“Please. Lead the way, Miss Steele,” he says. I try for nonchalance as I come out from

behind the counter, but really I’m concentrating hard on not falling over my own feet – my

legs are suddenly the consistency of Jell-O. I’m so glad I decided to wear my best jeans

this morning.

“They’re in with the electrical goods, aisle eight.” My voice is a little too bright. I

glance up at him and regret it almost immediately. Damn, he’s handsome. I blush.

“After you,” he murmurs, gesturing with his long-fingered, beautifully manicured

hand.With my heart almost strangling me – because it’s in my throat trying to escape from

my mouth – I head down one of the aisles to the electrical section. Why is he in Portland?

Why is he here at Clayton’s? And from a very tiny, underused part of my brain – probably

located at the base of my medulla oblongata where my subconscious dwells – comes the

thought: he’s here to see you. No way! I dismiss it immediately. Why would this beauti-

ful, powerful, urbane man want to see me? The idea is preposterous, and I kick it out of

my head.

“Are you in Portland on business?” I ask, and my voice is too high, like I’ve got my

finger trapped in a door or something. Damn! Try to be cool Ana!

“I was visiting the WSU farming division. It’s based at Vancouver. I’m currently fund-

ing some research there in crop rotation and soil science,” he says matter-of-factly. See?

Not here to find you at all, my subconscious sneers at me, loud, proud, and pouty. I flush

at my foolish wayward thoughts.

“All part of your feed-the-world plan?” I tease.

“Something like that,” he acknowledges, and his lips quirk up in a half smile.

He gazes at the selection of cable ties we stock at Clayton’s. What on Earth is he going

to do with those? I cannot picture him as a do-it-yourselfer at all. His fingers trail across

the various packages displayed, and for some inexplicable reason, I have to look away. He

bends and selects a packet.

“These will do,” he says with his oh-so-secret smile, and I blush.

“Is there anything else?”

“I’d like some masking tape.”

Masking tape?

“Are you redecorating?” The words are out before I can stop them. Surely he hires

laborers or has staff to help him decorate?

“No, not redecorating,” he says quickly then smirks, and I have the uncanny feeling

that he’s laughing at me.

Am I that funny? Funny looking?

“This way,” I murmur embarrassed. “Masking tape is in the decorating aisle.”

I glance behind me as he follows.

“Have you worked here long?” His voice is low, and he’s gazing at me, gray eyes con-

centrating hard. I blush even more brightly. Why the hell does he have this effect on me?

I feel like I’m fourteen years old – gauche, as always, and out of place. Eyes front Steele!

“Four years,” I mutter as we reach our goal. To distract myself, I reach down and select

the two widths of masking tape that we stock.

“I’ll take that one,” Grey says softly pointing to the wider tape, which I pass to him.

Our fingers brush very briefly, and the current is there again, zapping through me like I’ve

touched an exposed wire. I gasp involuntarily as I feel it, all the way down to somewhere

dark and unexplored, deep in my belly. Desperately, I scrabble around for my equilibrium.

“Anything else?” My voice is husky and breathy. His eyes widen slightly.

“Some rope, I think.” His voice mirrors mine, husky.

“This way.” I duck my head down to hide my recurring blush and head for the aisle.

“What sort were you after? We have synthetic and natural filament rope… twine…

cable cord… ” I halt at his expression, his eyes darkening. Holy cow.

“I’ll take five yards of the natural filament rope please.”

Quickly, with trembling fingers, I measure out five yards against the fixed ruler, aware

that his hot gray gaze is on me. I dare not look at him. Jeez, could I feel any more self-

conscious? Taking my Stanley knife from the back pocket of my jeans, I cut it then coil it

neatly before tying it in a slipknot. By some miracle, I manage not to remove a finger with

my knife.

“Were you a Girl Scout?” he asks, sculptured, sensual lips curled in amusement. Don’t

look at his mouth!

“Organized, group activities aren’t really my thing, Mr. Grey.”

He arches a brow.

“What is your thing, Anastasia?” he asks, his voice soft and his secret smile is back. I

gaze at him unable to express myself. I’m on shifting tectonic plates. Try and be cool, Ana,

my tortured subconscious begs on bended knee.

“Books,” I whisper, but inside, my subconscious is screaming: You! You are my thing!

I slap it down instantly, mortified that my psyche is having ideas above its station.

“What kind of books?” He cocks his head to one side. Why is he so interested?

“Oh, you know. The usual. The classics. British literature, mainly.”

He rubs his chin with his long index finger and thumb as he contemplates my answer.

Or perhaps he’s just very bored and trying to hide it.

“Anything else you need?” I have to get off this subject – those fingers on that face are

so beguiling.

“I don’t know. What else would you recommend?”

What would I recommend? I don’t even know what you’re doing.

“For a do-it-yourselfer?”

He nods, gray eyes alive with wicked humor. I flush, and my eyes stray of their own

accord to his snug jeans.

“Coveralls,” I reply, and I know I’m no longer screening what’s coming out of my

mouth.

He raises an eyebrow, amused, yet again.

“You wouldn’t want to ruin your clothing,” I gesture vaguely in the direction of his

jeans.

“I could always take them off.” He smirks.

“Um.” I feel the color in my cheeks rising again. I must be the color of the communist

manifesto. Stop talking. Stop talking NOW.

“I’ll take some coveralls. Heaven forbid I should ruin any clothing,” he says dryly.

I try and dismiss the unwelcome image of him without jeans.

“Do you need anything else?” I squeak as I hand him the blue coveralls.

He ignores my inquiry.

“How’s the article coming along?”

He’s finally asked me a normal question, away from all the innuendo and the confusing

double talk… a question I can answer. I grasp it tightly with two hands as if were a life

raft, and I go for honesty.

“I’m not writing it, Katherine is. Miss Kavanagh. My roommate, she’s the writer.

She’s very happy with it. She’s the editor of the magazine, and she was devastated that

she couldn’t do the interview in person.” I feel like I’ve come up for air – at last, a normal

topic of conversation. “Her only concern is that she doesn’t have any original photographs

of you.”

Grey raises an eyebrow.

“What sort of photographs does she want?”

Okay. I hadn’t factored in this response. I shake my head, because I just don’t know.

“Well, I’m around. Tomorrow, perhaps… ” he trails off.

“You’d be willing to attend a photo shoot?” My voice is squeaky again. Kate will be

in seventh heaven if I can pull this off. And you might see him again tomorrow, that dark

place at the base of my brain whispers seductively at me. I dismiss the thought – of all the

silly, ridiculous…

“Kate will be delighted – if we can find a photographer.” I’m so pleased, I smile at him

broadly. His lips part, like he’s taking a sharp intake of breath, and he blinks. For a fraction

of a second, he looks lost somehow, and the Earth shifts slightly on its axis, the tectonic

plates sliding into a new position.

Oh my. Christian Grey’s lost look.

“Let me know about tomorrow.” Reaching into his back pocket, he pulls out his wal-

let. “My card. It has my cell number on it. You’ll need to call before ten in the morning.”

“Okay.” I grin up at him. Kate is going to be thrilled.

“ANA!”

Paul has materialized at other the end of the aisle. He’s Mr. Clayton’s youngest broth-

er. I’d heard he was home from Princeton, but I wasn’t expecting to see him today.

“Er, excuse me for a moment, Mr. Grey.” Grey frowns as I turn away from him.

Paul has always been a buddy, and in this strange moment that I’m having with the

rich, powerful, awesomely off-the-scale attractive control-freak Grey, it’s great to talk to

someone who’s normal. Paul hugs me hard taking me by surprise.

“Ana, hi, it’s so good to see you!” he gushes.

“Hello Paul, how are you? You home for your brother’s birthday?”

“Yep. You’re looking well, Ana, really well.” He grins as he examines me at arm’s

length. Then he releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder. I shuffle

from foot to foot, embarrassed. It’s good to see Paul, but he’s always been over-familiar.

When I glance up at Christian Grey, he’s watching us like a hawk, his gray eyes hooded

and speculative, his mouth a hard impassive line. He’s changed from the weirdly attentive

customer to someone else – someone cold and distant.

“Paul, I’m with a customer. Someone you should meet,” I say, trying to defuse the

antagonism I see in Grey’s eyes. I drag Paul over to meet him, and they weigh each other

up. The atmosphere is suddenly arctic.

“Er, Paul, this is Christian Grey. Mr. Grey, this is Paul Clayton. His brother owns the

place.” And for some irrational reason, I feel I have to explain a bit more.

“I’ve known Paul ever since I’ve worked here, though we don’t see each other that

often. He’s back from Princeton where he’s studying business administration.” I’m bab-

bling… Stop, now!

“Mr. Clayton.” Christian holds his hand out, his look unreadable.

“Mr. Grey,” Paul returns his handshake. “Wait up – not the Christian Grey? Of Grey

Enterprises Holdings?” Paul goes from surly to awestruck in less than a nanosecond. Grey

gives him a polite smile that doesn’t reach his eyes.

“Wow – is there anything I can get you?”

“Anastasia has it covered, Mr. Clayton. She’s been very attentive.” His expression is

impassive, but his words… it’s like he’s saying something else entirely. It’s baffling.

“Cool,” Paul responds. “Catch you later, Ana.”

“Sure, Paul.” I watch him disappear toward the stock room. “Anything else, Mr.

Grey?”

“Just these items.” His tone is clipped and cool. Damn… have I offended him? Tak-

ing a deep breath, I turn and head for the till. What is his problem?

I ring up the rope, coveralls, masking tape, and cable ties at the till.

“That will be forty-three dollars, please.” I glance up at Grey, and I wish I hadn’t. He’s

watching me closely, his gray eyes intense and smoky. It’s unnerving.

“Would you like a bag?” I ask as I take his credit card.

“Please, Anastasia.” His tongue caresses my name, and my heart once again is frantic.

I can hardly breathe. Hurriedly, I place his purchases in a plastic carrier.

“You’ll call me if you want me to do the photo shoot?” He’s all business once more. I

nod, rendered speechless yet again, and hand back his credit card.

“Good. Until tomorrow perhaps.” He turns to leave, then pauses. “Oh – and Anastasia,

I’m glad Miss Kavanagh couldn’t do the interview.” He smiles, then strides with renewed

purpose out of the store, slinging the plastic bag over his shoulder, leaving me a quiver-

ing mass of raging female hormones. I spend several minutes staring at the closed door

through which he’s just left before I return to planet Earth.

Okay – I like him. There, I’ve admitted it to myself. I cannot hide from my feelings

anymore. I’ve never felt like this before. I find him attractive, very attractive. But it’s a

lost cause, I know, and I sigh with bittersweet regret. It was just a coincidence, his coming

here. But still, I can admire him from afar, surely? No harm can come of that. And if I find

a photographer, I can do some serious admiring tomorrow. I bite my lip in anticipation and

find myself grinning like a schoolgirl. I need to phone Kate and organize a photo-shoot.



Kate is ecstatic.

“But what was he doing at Clayton’s?” Her curiosity oozes through the phone. I’m in

the depths of the stock room, trying to keep my voice casual.

“He was in the area.”

“I think that is one huge coincidence, Ana. You don’t think he was there to see you?”

she speculates. My heart lurches at the prospect, but it’s a short-lived joy. The dull, disap-

pointing reality is that he was here on business.

“He was visiting the farming division of WSU. He’s funding some research,” I mutter.

“Oh yes. He’s given the department a $2.5 million grant.”

Wow.

“How do you know this?”

“Ana, I’m a journalist, and I’ve written a profile on the guy. It’s my job to know this.”

“Okay, Carla Bernstein, keep your hair on. So do you want these photos?”

“Of course I do. The question is, who’s going to do them and where.”

“We could ask him where. He says he’s staying in the area.”

“You can contact him?”

“I have his cell phone number.”

Kate gasps.

“The richest, most elusive, most enigmatic bachelor in Washington State, just gave you

his cell phone number.”

“Er… yes.”

“Ana! He likes you. No doubt about it.” Her tone is emphatic.

“Kate, he’s just trying to be nice.” But even as I say the words, I know they’re not true

– Christian Grey doesn’t do nice. He does polite, maybe. And a small quiet voice whis-

pers, perhaps Kate is right. My scalp prickles at the idea that maybe, just maybe, he might

like me. After all, he did say he was glad Kate didn’t do the interview. I hug myself with

quiet glee, rocking from side to side, entertaining the possibility that he might like me for

one brief moment. Kate brings me back to the now.

“I don’t know who we’ll get to do the shoot. Levi, our regular photographer, can’t.

He’s home in Idaho Falls for the weekend. He’ll be pissed that he blew an opportunity to

photo one of America’s leading entrepreneurs.”

“Hmm… What about José?”

“Great idea! You ask him – he’ll do anything for you. Then call Grey and find out

where he wants us.” Kate is irritatingly cavalier about José.

“I think you should call him.”

“Who, José?” Kate scoffs.

“No, Grey.”

“Ana, you’re the one with the relationship.”

“Relationship?” I squeak at her, my voice rising several octaves. “I barely know the

guy.”“At least you’ve met him,” she says bitterly. “And it looks like he wants to know you

better. Ana, just call him,” she snaps and hangs up. She is so bossy sometimes. I frown at

my cell, sticking my tongue out at it.

I’m just leaving a message for José when Paul enters the stock room looking for sand-

paper.

“We’re kind of busy out there, Ana,” he says without acrimony.

“Yeah, um, sorry,” I mutter, turning to leave.

“So, how come you know Christian Grey?” Paul’s voice is unconvincingly nonchalant.

“I had to interview him for our student newspaper. Kate wasn’t well.” I shrug, trying

to sound casual and doing no better than him.

“Christian Grey in Clayton’s. Go figure,” Paul snorts, amazed. He shakes his head as

if to clear it. “Anyway, want to grab a drink or something this evening?”

Whenever he’s home he asks me on a date, and I always say no. It’s a ritual. I’ve never

considered it a good idea to date the boss’s brother, and besides, Paul is cute in a whole-

some all-American boy-next-door kind of way, but he’s no literary hero, not by any stretch

of the imagination. Is Grey? My subconscious asks me, her eyebrow figuratively raised.

I slap her down.

“Don’t you have a family dinner or something for your brother?”

“That’s tomorrow.”

“Maybe some other time, Paul. I need to study tonight. I have my finals next week.”

“Ana, one of these days, you’ll say yes,” he smiles as I escape out to the store floor.

“But I do places, Ana, not people,” José groans.

“José, please?” I beg. Clutching my cell, I pace the living area of our apartment, star-

ing out of the window at the fading evening light.

“Give me that phone.” Kate grabs the handset from me, tossing her silken red-blonde

hair over her shoulder.

“Listen here, José Rodriquez, if you want our newspaper to cover the opening of your

show, you’ll do this shoot for us tomorrow, capiche?” Kate can be awesomely tough.

“Good. Ana will call back with the location and the call time. We’ll see you tomor-

row.” She snaps my cell phone shut.

“Sorted. All we need to do now is decide where and when. Call him.” She holds the

phone out to me. My stomach twists.

“Call Grey, now!”

I scowl at her and reach into my back pocket for his business card. I take a deep,

steadying breath, and with shaking fingers, I dial the number.

He answers on the second ring. His tone is clipped, calm and cold.

“Grey.”

“Err… Mr. Grey? It’s Anastasia Steele.” I don’t recognize my own voice, I’m so ner-

vous. There’s a brief pause. Inside I’m quaking.

“Miss Steele. How nice to hear from you.” His voice has changed. He’s surprised, I

think, and he sounds so… warm – seductive even. My breath hitches, and I flush. I’m sud-

denly conscious that Katherine Kavanagh is staring at me, her mouth open, and I dart into

the kitchen to avoid her unwanted scrutiny.

“Err – we’d like to go ahead with the photo-shoot for the article.” Breathe, Ana, breathe.

My lungs drag in a hasty breath. “Tomorrow, if that’s okay. Where would be convenient

for you, sir?”

I can almost hear his sphinx-like smile through the phone.

“I’m staying at the Heathman in Portland. Shall we say, nine thirty tomorrow morn-

ing?”“Okay, we’ll see you there.” I am all gushing and breathy – like a child, not a grown

woman who can vote and drink legally in the State of Washington.

“I look forward to it, Miss Steele.” I visualize the wicked gleam in his gray eyes. How

can he make seven little words hold so much tantalizing promise? I hang up. Kate is in the

kitchen, and she’s staring at me with a look of complete and utter consternation on her face.

“Anastasia Rose Steele. You like him! I’ve never seen or heard you so, so… affected

by anyone before. You’re actually blushing.”

“Oh Kate, you know I blush all the time. It’s an occupational hazard with me. Don’t

be so ridiculous,” I snap. She blinks at me with surprise – I very rarely throw my toys out

of the pram – and I briefly relent. “I just find him… intimidating, that’s all.”

“Heathman, that figures,” mutters Kate. “I’ll give the manager a call and negotiate a

space for the shoot.”

“I’ll make supper. Then I need to study.” I cannot hide my irritation with her as I open

one of cupboards to make supper.

I am restless that night, tossing and turning. Dreaming of smoky gray eyes, coveralls, long

legs, long fingers, and dark, dark unexplored places. I wake twice in the night, my heart

pounding. Oh, I’m going to look just great tomorrow with so little sleep, I scold myself. I

punch my pillow and try to settle.

The Heathman is nestled in the downtown heart of Portland. Its impressive brown stone

edifice was completed just in time for the crash of the late 1920s. José, Travis, and I are

traveling in my Beetle, and Kate is in her CLK, since we can’t all fit in my car. Travis is

José’s friend and gopher, here to help out with the lighting. Kate has managed to acquire

the use of a room at the Heathman free of charge for the morning in exchange for a credit

in the article. When she explains at reception that we’re here to photograph Christian Grey

CEO, we are instantly upgraded to a suite. Just a regular-sized suite, however, as apparent-

ly Mr. Grey is already occupying the largest one in the building. An over-keen marketing

executive shows us up to the suite – he’s terribly young and very nervous for some reason.

I suspect it’s Kate’s beauty and commanding manner that disarms him, because he’s putty

in her hands. The rooms are elegant, understated, and opulently furnished.

It’s nine. We have half an hour to set up. Kate is in full flow.

“José, I think we’ll shoot against that wall, do you agree?” She doesn’t wait for his

reply. “Travis, clear the chairs. Ana, could you ask housekeeping to bring up some refresh-

ments? And let Grey know where we are.”

Yes, Mistress. She is so domineering. I roll my eyes, but do as I’m told.

Half an hour later, Christian Grey walks into our suite.

Holy Crap! He’s wearing a white shirt, open at the collar, and grey flannel pants that

hang from his hips. His unruly hair is still damp from a shower. My mouth goes dry

looking at him… he’s so freaking hot. Grey is followed into the suite by a man in his

mid-thirties, all buzz-cut and stubble in a sharp dark suit and tie who stands silently in the

corner. His hazel eyes watch us impassively.

“Miss Steele, we meet again.” Grey extends his hand, and I shake it, blinking rapidly.

Oh my… he really is, quite… wow. As I touch his hand, I’m aware of that delicious cur-

rent running right through me, lighting me up, making me blush, and I’m sure my erratic

breathing must be audible.

“Mr. Grey, this is Katherine Kavanagh,” I mutter, waving a hand toward Kate who

comes forward, looking him squarely in the eye.

“The tenacious Miss Kavanagh. How do you do?” He gives her a small smile, look-

ing genuinely amused. “I trust you’re feeling better? Anastasia said you were unwell last

week.”

“I’m fine, thank you, Mr. Grey.” She shakes his hand firmly without batting an eyelid.

I remind myself that Kate has been to the best private schools in Washington. Her family

has money, and she’s grown up confident and sure of her place in the world. She doesn’t

take any crap. I am in awe of her.

“Thank you for taking the time to do this.” She gives him a polite, professional smile.

“It’s a pleasure,” he answers, turning his gray gaze on me, and I flush, again. Damn it.

“This is José Rodriguez, our photographer,” I say, grinning at José who smiles with

affection back at me. His eyes cool when he looks from me to Grey.

“Mr. Grey,” he nods.

“Mr. Rodriguez,” Grey’s expression changes too as he appraises José.

“Where would you like me?” Grey asks him. His tone sounds vaguely threatening. But

Katherine is not about to let José run the show.

“Mr. Grey – if you could sit here, please? Be careful of the lighting cables. And then

we’ll do a few standing, too.” She directs him to a chair set up against the wall.

Travis switches on the lights, momentarily blinding Grey, and mutters an apology.

Then Travis and I stand back and watch as José proceeds to snap away. He takes several

photographs hand-held, asking Grey to turn this way, then that, to move his arm, then put

it down again. Moving to the tripod, José takes several more, while Grey sits and poses,

patiently and naturally, for about twenty minutes. My wish has come true: I can stand and

admire Grey from not-so-afar. Twice our eyes lock, and I have to tear myself away from

his cloudy gaze.

“Enough sitting.” Katherine wades in again. “Standing, Mr. Grey?” she asks.

He stands, and Travis scurries in to remove the chair. The shutter on José’s Nikon

starts clicking again.

“I think we have enough,” José announces five minutes later.

“Great,” says Kate. “Thank you again, Mr. Grey.” She shakes his hand, as does José.

“I look forward to reading the article, Miss Kavanagh,” murmurs Grey, and turns to

me, standing by the door. “Will you walk with me, Miss Steele?” he asks.

“Sure,” I say, completely thrown. I glance anxiously at Kate, who shrugs at me. I

notice José scowling behind her.

“Good day to you all,” says Grey as he opens the door, standing aside to allow me out

first.

Holy hell… what’s this about? What does he want? I pause in the hotel corridor, fidg-

eting nervously as Grey emerges from the room followed by Mr. Buzz-Cut in his sharp suit.

“I’ll call you, Taylor,” he murmurs to Buzz-Cut. Taylor wanders back down the cor-

ridor, and Grey turns his burning gray gaze to me. Crap… have I done something wrong?

“I wondered if you would join me for coffee this morning.”

My heart slams into my mouth. A date? Christian Grey is asking me on a date. He’s

asking if you want a coffee. Maybe he thinks you haven’t woken up yet, my subconscious

whines at me in a sneering mood again. I clear my throat trying to control my nerves.

“I have to drive everyone home,” I murmur apologetically, twisting my hands and

fingers in front of me.

“TAYLOR,” he calls, making me jump. Taylor, who had been retreating down the cor-

ridor, turns and heads back toward us.

“Are they based at the university?” Grey asks, his voice soft and inquiring. I nod, too

stunned to speak.

“Taylor can take them. He’s my driver. We have a large 4x4 here, so he’ll be able to

take the equipment too.”

“Mr. Grey?” Taylor asks when he reaches us, giving nothing away.

“Please, can you drive the photographer, his assistant, and Miss Kavanagh back home?”

“Certainly, sir,” Taylor replies.

“There. Now can you join me for coffee?” Grey smiles as if it’s a done deal.

I frown at him.

“Um – Mr. Grey, err – this really… look, Taylor doesn’t have to drive them home.” I

flash a brief look at Taylor, who remains stoically impassive. “I’ll swap vehicles with Kate,

if you give me a moment.”

Grey smiles a dazzling, unguarded, natural, all-teeth-showing, glorious smile. Oh

my… and he opens the door of the suite so I can re-enter. I scoot around him to enter the

room, finding Katherine in deep discussion with José.

“Ana, I think he definitely likes you,” she says with no preamble whatsoever. José

glares at me with disapproval. “But I don’t trust him,” she adds. I raise my hand up in the

hope that she’ll stop talking. By some miracle, she does.

“Kate, if you take the Beetle, can I take your car?”

“Why?”

“Christian Grey has asked me to go for coffee with him.”

Her mouth pops open. Speechless Kate! I savor the moment. She grabs me by my arm

and drags me into the bedroom that’s off the living area of the suite.

“Ana, there’s something about him.” Her tone is full of warning. “He’s gorgeous, I

agree, but I think he’s dangerous. Especially to someone like you.”

“What do you mean, someone like me?” I demand, affronted.

“An innocent like you, Ana. You know what I mean,” she says a little irritated. I flush.

“Kate, it’s just coffee. I’m starting my exams this week, and I need to study, so I won’t

be long.”

She purses her lips as if considering my request. Finally, she fishes her car keys out of

her pocket and hands them to me. I hand her mine.

“I’ll see you later. Don’t be long, or I’ll send out search and rescue.”

“Thanks.” I hug her.

I emerge from the suite to find Christian Grey waiting, leaning up against the wall,

looking like a male model in a pose for some glossy high-end magazine.

“Okay, let’s do coffee,” I murmur, flushing a beet red.

He grins.

“After you, Miss Steele.” He stands up straight, holding his hand out for me to go first.

I make my way down the corridor, my knees shaky, my stomach full of butterflies, and

my heart in my mouth thumping a dramatic uneven beat. I am going to have coffee with

Christian Grey... and I hate coffee.

We walk together down the wide hotel corridor to the elevators. What should I say to

him? My mind is suddenly paralyzed with apprehension. What are we going to talk about?

What on Earth do I have in common with him? His soft, warm voice startles me from my

reverie.

“How long have you known Katherine Kavanagh?”

Oh, an easy questions for starters.

“Since our freshman year. She’s a good friend.”

“Hmm,” he replies, non-committal. What is he thinking?

At the elevators, he presses the call button, and the bell rings almost immediately. The

doors slide open revealing a young couple in a passionate clinch inside. Surprised and

embarrassed, they jump apart, staring guiltily in every direction but ours. Grey and I step

into the elevator.

I am struggling to maintain a straight face, so I gaze down at the floor, feeling my

cheeks turning pink. When I peek up at Grey through my lashes, he has a hint of a smile

on his lips, but it’s very hard to tell. The young couple says nothing, and we travel down to

the first floor in embarrassed silence. We don’t even have trashy piped music to distract us.

The doors open and, much to my surprise, Grey takes my hand, clasping it with his

long cool fingers. I feel the current run through me, and my already rapid heartbeat accel-

erates. As he leads me out of the elevator, we can hear the suppressed giggles of the couple

erupting behind us. Grey grins.

“What is it about elevators?” he mutters.

We cross the expansive, bustling lobby of the hotel toward the entrance but Grey avoids

the revolving door, and I wonder if that’s because he’d have to let go of my hand.

Outside, it’s a mild May Sunday. The sun is shining and the traffic is light. Grey turns

left and strolls to the corner, where we stop waiting for the lights of the pedestrian crossing

to change. He’s still holding my hand. I’m in the street, and Christian Grey is holding

my hand. No one has ever held my hand. I feel giddy, and I tingle all over. I attempt to

smother the ridiculous grin that threatens to split my face in two. Try to be cool, Ana, my

subconscious implores me. The green man appears, and we’re off again.

We walk four blocks before we reach the Portland Coffee House, where Grey releases

me to hold the door open so I can step inside.

“Why don’t you choose a table, while I get the drinks. What would you like?” he asks,

polite as ever.

“I’ll have… um – English Breakfast tea, bag out.”

He raises his eyebrows.

“No coffee?”

“I’m not keen on coffee.”

He smiles.

“Okay, bag out tea. Sugar?”

For a moment, I’m stunned, thinking it’s an endearment, but fortunately my subcon-

scious kicks in with pursed lips. No, stupid – do you take sugar?

“No thanks.” I stare down at my knotted fingers.

“Anything to eat?”

“No thank you.” I shake my head, and he heads to the counter.

I surreptitiously gaze at him from beneath my lashes as he stands in line waiting to

be served. I could watch him all day… he’s tall, broad-shouldered, and slim, and the way

those pants hang from his hips… Oh my. Once or twice he runs his long, graceful fingers

through his now dry but still disorderly hair. Hmm… I’d like to do that. The thought comes

unbidden into my mind, and my face flames. I bite my lip and stare down at my hands

again not liking where my wayward thoughts are headed.

“Penny for your thoughts?” Grey is back, startling me.

I go crimson. I was just thinking about running my fingers through your hair and

wondering if it would feel soft to touch. I shake my head. He’s carrying a tray, which he

sets down on the small, round, birch-veneer table. He hands me a cup and saucer, a small

teapot, and a side plate bearing a lone teabag labeled ‘Twinings English Breakfast’ – my

favorite. He has a coffee which bears a wonderful leaf-pattern imprinted in the milk. How

do they do that? I wonder idly. He’s also bought himself a blueberry muffin. Putting the

tray aside, he sits opposite me and crosses his long legs. He looks so comfortable, so at

ease with his body, I envy him. Here’s me, all gawky and uncoordinated, barely able to get

from A to B without falling flat on my face.

“Your thoughts?” he prompts me.

“This is my favorite tea.” My voice is quiet, breathy. I simply can’t believe I’m sitting

opposite Christian Grey in a coffee shop in Portland. He frowns. He knows I’m hiding

something. I pop the teabag into the teapot and almost immediately fish it out again with

my teaspoon. As I place the used teabag back on the side plate, he cocks his head gazing

quizzically at me.

“I like my tea black and weak,” I mutter as an explanation.

“I see. Is he your boyfriend?”

Whoa… What?

“Who?”

“The photographer. José Rodriguez.”

I laugh, nervous but curious. What gave him that impression?

“No. José’s a good friend of mine, that’s all. Why did you think he was my boyfriend?”

“The way you smiled at him, and he at you.” His gray gaze holds mine. He’s so un-

nerving. I want to look away but I’m caught – spellbound.

“He’s more like family,” I whisper.

Grey nods slightly, seemingly satisfied with my response, and glances down at his

blueberry muffin. His long fingers deftly peel back the paper, and I watch, fascinated.

“Do you want some?” he asks, and that amused, secret smile is back.

“No thanks.” I frown and stare down at my hands again.

“And the boy I met yesterday, at the store. He’s not your boyfriend?”

“No. Paul’s just a friend. I told you yesterday.” Oh, this is getting silly. “Why do you

ask?”“You seem nervous around men.”

Holy crap, that’s personal. I’m just nervous around you, Grey.

“I find you intimidating.” I flush scarlet, but mentally pat myself on the back for my

candor, and gaze at my hands again. I hear his sharp intake of breath.

“You should find me intimidating,” he nods. “You’re very honest. Please don’t look

down. I like to see your face.”

Oh. I glance at him, and he gives me an encouraging but wry smile.

“It gives me some sort of clue what you might be thinking,” he breathes. “You’re a

mystery, Miss Steele.

Mysterious? Me?

“There’s nothing mysterious about me.”

“I think you’re very self-contained,” he murmurs.

Am I? Wow… how am I managing that? This is bewildering. Me, self-contained?

No Way.

“Except when you blush, of course, which is often. I just wish I knew what you were

blushing about.” He pops a small piece of muffin into his mouth and starts to chew it

slowly, not taking his eyes off me. And as if on cue, I blush. Crap!

“Do you always make such personal observations?”

“I hadn’t realized I was. Have I offended you?” He sounds surprised.

“No,” I answer truthfully.

“Good.”

“But you’re very high-handed,” I retaliate quietly.

He raises his eyebrows and, if I’m not mistaken, he flushes slightly too.

“I’m used to getting my own way, Anastasia,” he murmurs. “In all things.”

“I don’t doubt it. Why haven’t you asked me to call you by your first name?” I’m sur-

prised by my audacity. Why has this conversation become so serious? This isn’t going the

way I thought it was going to go. I can’t believe I’m feeling so antagonistic towards him.

It’s like he’s trying to warn me off.

“The only people who use my given name are my family and a few close friends.

That’s the way I like it.”

Oh. He still hasn’t said, ‘Call me Christian.’ He is a control freak, there’s no other

explanation, and part of me is thinking maybe it would have been better if Kate had in-

terviewed him. Two control freaks together. Plus of course she’s almost blonde – well,

strawberry blonde – like all the women in his office. And she’s beautiful, my subconscious

reminds me. I don’t like the idea of Christian and Kate. I take a sip of my tea, and Grey

eats another small piece of his muffin.

“Are you an only child?” he asks.

Whoa… he keeps changing direction.

“Yes.”

“Tell me about your parents.”

Why does he want to know this? It’s so dull.

“My mom lives in Georgia with her new husband Bob. My stepdad lives in Monte-

sano.”

“Your father?”

“My father died when I was a baby.”

“I’m sorry,” he mutters and a fleeting troubled look crosses his face.

“I don’t remember him.”

“And your mother remarried?”

I snort.

“You could say that.”

He frowns at me.

“You’re not giving much away, are you?” he says dryly, rubbing his chin as if in deep

thought.

“Neither are you.”

“You’ve interviewed me once already, and I can recollect some quite probing questions

then.” He smirks at me.

Holy shit. He’s remembering the ‘gay’ question. Once again, I’m mortified. In years

to come, I know, I’ll need intensive therapy to not feel this embarrassed every time I recall

the moment. I start babbling about my mother – anything to block that memory.

“My mom is wonderful. She’s an incurable romantic. She’s currently on her fourth

husband.”

Christian raises his eyebrows in surprise.

“I miss her,” I continue. “She has Bob now. I just hope he can keep an eye on her and

pick up the pieces when her harebrained schemes don’t go as planned.” I smile fondly. I

haven’t seen my mom for so long. Christian is watching me intently, taking occasional sips

of his coffee. I really shouldn’t look at his mouth. It’s unsettling. Those lips.

“Do you get along with your stepfather?”

“Of course. I grew up with him. He’s the only father I know.”

“And what’s he like?”

“Ray? He’s… taciturn.”

“That’s it?” Grey asks, surprised.

I shrug. What does this man expect? My life story?

“Taciturn like his stepdaughter,” Grey prompts.

I refrain from rolling my eyes at him.

“He likes soccer – European soccer especially – and bowling, and fly-fishing, and mak-

ing furniture. He’s a carpenter. Ex-army.” I sigh.

“You lived with him?”

“Yes. My mom met Husband Number Three when I was fifteen. I stayed with Ray.”

He frowns as if he doesn’t understand.

“You didn’t want to live with your mom?” he asks.

I blush. This really is none of his business.

“Husband Number Three lived in Texas. My home was in Montesano. And… you

know my mom was newly married.” I stop. My mom never talks about Husband Number

Three. Where is Grey going with this? This is none of his business. Two can play at this

game.

“Tell me about your parents,” I ask.

He shrugs.

“My dad’s a lawyer, my mom is a pediatrician. They live in Seattle.”

Oh… he’s had an affluent upbringing. And I wonder about a successful couple who

adopt three kids, and one of them turns into a beautiful man who takes on the business

world and conquers it single-handed. What drove him to be that way? His folks must be

proud.

“What do your siblings do?”

“Elliot’s in construction, and my little sister is in Paris, studying cookery under some

renowned French chef.” His eyes cloud with irritation. He doesn’t want to talk about his

family or himself.

“I hear Paris is lovely,” I murmur. Why doesn’t he want to talk about his family? Is it

because he’s adopted?

“It’s beautiful. Have you been?” he asks, his irritation forgotten.

“I’ve never left mainland USA.” So now we’re back to banalities. What is he hiding?

“Would you like to go?”

“To Paris?” I squeak. This has thrown me – who wouldn’t want to go to Paris? “Of

course,” I concede. “But it’s England that I’d really like to visit.”

He cocks his head to one side, running his index finger across his lower lip… oh my.

“Because?”

I blink rapidly. Concentrate, Steele.

“It’s the home of Shakespeare, Austen, the Brontë sisters, Thomas Hardy. I’d like to

see the places that inspired those people to write such wonderful books.”

All this talk of literary greats reminds me that I should be studying. I glance at my

watch.

“I’d better go. I have to study.”

“For your exams?”

“Yes. They start Tuesday.”

“Where’s Miss Kavanagh’s car?”

“In the hotel parking lot.”

“I’ll walk you back.”

“Thank you for the tea, Mr. Grey.”

He smiles his odd I’ve got a whopping big secret smile.

“You’re welcome, Anastasia. It’s my pleasure. Come,” he commands, and holds his

hand out to me. I take it, bemused, and follow him out of the coffee shop.

We stroll back to the hotel, and I’d like to say it’s in companionable silence. He at

least looks his usual calm, collected self. As for me, I’m desperately trying to gauge how

our little coffee morning has gone. I feel like I’ve been interviewed for a position, but I’m

not sure what it is.

“Do you always wear jeans?” he asks out of the blue.

“Mostly.”

He nods. We’re back at the intersection, across the road from the hotel. My mind is

reeling. What an odd question… And I’m aware that our time together is limited. This is

it. This was it, and I’ve completely blown it, I know. Perhaps he has someone.

“Do you have a girlfriend?” I blurt out. Holy crap - I just said that out loud?

His lips quirk up in a half-smile, and he looks down at me.

“No, Anastasia. I don’t do the girlfriend thing,” he says softly.

Oh… what does that mean? He’s not gay? Oh, maybe he is - crap! He must have

lied to me in his interview. And for a moment, I think he’s going to follow on with some

explanation, some clue to this cryptic statement – but he doesn’t. I have to go. I have to

try to reassemble my thoughts. I have to get away from him. I walk forward, and I trip,

stumbling headlong onto the road.

“Shit, Ana!” Grey cries. He tugs the hand that he’s holding so hard that I fall back

against him just as a cyclist whips past, narrowly missing me, heading the wrong way up

this one-way street.

It all happens so fast – one minute I’m falling, the next I’m in his arms, and he’s hold-

ing me tightly against his chest. .I inhale his clean, vital scent. He smells of fresh laundered

linen and some expensive body-wash. Oh my, it’s intoxicating. I inhale deeply.

“Are you okay?” he whispers. He has one arm around me, clasping me to him, while

the fingers of his other hand softly trace my face, gently probing, examining me. His

thumb brushes my lower lip, and I hear his breath hitch. He’s staring into my eyes, and I

hold his anxious, burning gaze for a moment or maybe it’s forever… but eventually, my at-

tention is drawn to his beautiful mouth. Oh my. And for the first time in twenty-one years,

I want to be kissed. I want to feel his mouth on me.



Kiss me damn it! I implore him, but I can’t move. I’m paralyzed with a strange, unfamiliar

need, completely captivated by him. I’m staring at Christian Grey’s exquisitely sculptured

mouth, mesmerized, and he’s looking down at me, his gaze hooded, his eyes darkening.

He’s breathing harder than usual, and I’ve stopped breathing altogether. I’m in your arms.

Kiss me, please. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and gives me a small shake of his

head as if in answer to my silent question. When he opens his eyes again, it’s with some

new purpose, a steely resolve.

“Anastasia, you should steer clear of me. I’m not the man for you,” he whispers.

What? Where is this coming from? Surely I should be the judge of that. I frown up at him,

and my head swims with rejection.

“Breathe, Anastasia, breathe. I’m going to stand you up and let you go,” he says qui-

etly, and he gently pushes me away.

Adrenaline has spiked through my body, from the near miss with the cyclist or the

heady proximity to Christian, leaving me wired and weak. NO! My psyche screams as

he pulls away, leaving me bereft. He has his hands on my shoulders, holding me at arm’s

length, watching my reactions carefully. And the only thing I can think is that I wanted

to be kissed, made it pretty damned obvious, and he didn’t do it. He doesn’t want me. He

really doesn’t want me. I have royally screwed up the coffee morning.

“I’ve got this,” I breathe, finding my voice. “Thank you,” I mutter awash with humili-

ation. How could I have misread the situation between us so utterly? I need to get away

from him.

“For what?” he frowns. He hasn’t taken his hands off me.

“For saving me,” I whisper.

“That idiot was riding the wrong way. I’m glad I was here. I shudder to think what

could have happened to you. Do you want to come and sit down in the hotel for a mo-

ment?” He releases me, his hands by his sides, and I’m standing in front of him feeling

like a fool.

With a shake, I clear my head. I just want to go. All my vague, unarticulated hopes

have been dashed. He doesn’t want me. What was I thinking? I scold myself. What would

Christian Grey want with you? My subconscious mocks me. I wrap my arms around my-

self and turn to face the road and note with relief that the green man has appeared. I quickly

make my way across, conscious that Grey is behind me. Outside the hotel, I turn briefly to

face him but cannot look him in the eye.

“Thanks for the tea and doing the photo shoot,” I murmur.

“Anastasia… I… ” He stops, and the anguish in his voice demands my attention, so I

peer unwillingly up at him. His gray eyes are bleak as he runs his hand through his hair.

He looks torn, frustrated, his expression stark, all his careful control has evaporated.

“What, Christian?” I snap irritably after he says – nothing. I just want to go. I need to

take my fragile, wounded pride away and somehow nurse it back to health.

“Good luck with your exams,” he murmurs.

Huh? This is why he looks so desolate? This is the big send off? Just to wish me luck

in my exams?

“Thanks.” I can’t disguise the sarcasm in my voice. “Goodbye, Mr. Grey.” I turn on

my heel, vaguely amazed that I don’t trip, and without giving him a second glance, I disap-

pear down the sidewalk toward the underground garage.

Once underneath the dark, cold concrete of the garage with its bleak fluorescent light,

I lean against the wall and put my head in my hands. What was I thinking? Unbidden and

unwelcome tears pool in my eyes. Why am I crying? I sink to the ground, angry at myself

for this senseless reaction. Drawing up my knees, I fold in on myself. I want to make

myself as small as possible. Perhaps this nonsensical pain will be smaller the smaller I am.

Placing my head on my knees, I let the irrational tears fall unrestrained. I am crying over

the loss of something I never had. How ridiculous. Mourning something that never was –

my dashed hopes, dashed dreams, and my soured expectations.

I have never been on the receiving end of rejection. Okay… so I was always one of the

last to be picked for basketball or volleyball – but I understood that – running and doing

something else at the same time like bouncing or throwing a ball is not my thing. I am a

serious liability in any sporting field.

Romantically, though, I’ve never put myself out there, ever. A lifetime of insecurity

– I’m too pale, too skinny, too scruffy, uncoordinated, my long list of faults goes on. So

I have always been the one to rebuff any would be admirers. There was that guy in my

chemistry class who liked me, but no one has ever sparked my interest – no one except

Christian damn Grey. Maybe I should be kinder to the likes of Paul Clayton and José Ro-

driguez, though I’m sure neither of them have been found sobbing alone in dark places.

Perhaps I just need a good cry.

Stop! Stop Now! - My subconscious is metaphorically screaming at me, arms folded,

leaning on one leg and tapping her foot in frustration. Get in the car, go home, do your

studying. Forget about him… Now! And stop all this self-pitying, wallowing crap.

I take a deep, steadying breath and stand up. Get it together Steele. I head for Kate’s

car, wiping the tears off my face as I do. I will not think of him again. I can just chalk this

incident up to experience and concentrate on my exams.

Kate is sitting at the dining table at her laptop when I arrive. Her welcoming smile fades

when she sees me.

“Ana what’s wrong?”

Oh no… not the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition. I shake my head at her in a back-off

now Kavanagh way – but I might as well be dealing with a blind, deaf mute.

“You’ve been crying,” she has an exceptional gift for stating the damned obvious

sometimes. “What did that bastard do to you?” she growls, and her face – jeez, she’s scary.

“Nothing Kate.” That’s actually the problem. The thought brings a wry smile to my

face.“Then why have you been crying? You never cry,” she says, her voice softening. She

stands, her green eyes brimming with concern. She puts her arms around me and hugs me.

I need to say something just to get her to back off.

“I was nearly knocked over by a cyclist.” It’s the best that I can do, but it distracts her

momentarily from… him.

“Jeez Ana – are you okay? Were you hurt?” She holds me at arm’s length and does a

quick visual check-up on me.

“No. Christian saved me,” I whisper. “But I was quite shaken.”

“I’m not surprised. How was coffee? I know you hate coffee.”

“I had tea. It was fine, nothing to report really. I don’t know why he asked me.”

“He likes you Ana.” She drops her arms.

“Not anymore. I won’t be seeing him again.” Yes, I manage to sound matter of fact.

“Oh?”

Crap. She’s intrigued. I head into the kitchen so that she can’t see my face.

“Yeah… he’s a little out of my league Kate,” I say as dryly as I can manage.

“What do you mean?”

“Oh Kate, it’s obvious.” I whirl round and face her as she stands in the kitchen door-

way.“Not to me,” she says. “Okay, he’s got more money than you, but then he has more

money than most people in America!”

“Kate he’s– ” I shrug.

“Ana! For heaven’s sake – how many times must I tell you? You’re a total babe,” she

interrupts me. Oh no. She’s off on this tirade again.

“Kate, please. I need to study.” I cut her short. She frowns.

“Do you want to see the article? It’s finished. José took some great pictures.”



Do I need a visual reminder of the beautiful Christian I-don’t-want-you Grey?

“Sure,” I magic a smile on to my face and stroll over to the laptop. And there he is,

staring at me in black and white, staring at me and finding me lacking.

I pretend to read the article, all the time meeting his steady gray gaze, searching the

photo for some clue as to why he’s not the man for me – his own words to me. And it’s

suddenly, blindingly obvious. He’s too gloriously good-looking. We are poles apart and

from two very different worlds. I have a vision of myself as Icarus flying too close to the

sun and crashing and burning as a result. His words make sense. He’s not the man for me.

This is what he meant, and it makes his rejection easier to accept… almost. I can live with

this. I understand.

“Very good Kate,” I manage. “I’m going to study.” I am not going to think about him

again for now, I vow to myself, and opening my revision notes, I start to read.

It’s only when I’m in bed, trying to sleep, that I allow my thoughts to drift through my

strange morning. I keep coming back to the ‘I don’t do the girlfriend thing’ quote, and I’m

angry that I didn’t pounce on this information sooner, when I was in his arms mentally beg-

ging him with every fiber of my being to kiss me. He’d said it there and then. He didn’t

want me as a girlfriend. I turn on to my side. Idly, I wonder if perhaps he’s celibate? I

close my eyes and begin to drift. Maybe he’s saving himself. Well not for you, my sleepy

subconscious has a final swipe at me before unleashing itself on my dreams.

And that night, I dream of gray eyes, leafy patterns in milk, and I’m running through

dark places with eerie strip lighting, and I don’t know if I’m running toward something or

away from it… it’s just not clear.

I put my pen down. Finished. My final exam is over. I feel the Cheshire cat grin

spread over my face. It’s probably the first time all week that I’ve smiled. It’s Friday, and

we shall be celebrating tonight, really celebrating. I might even get drunk! I’ve never been

drunk before. I glance across the sports hall at Kate, and she’s still scribbling furiously,

five minutes to the end. This is it, the end of my academic career. I shall never have to sit

in rows of anxious, isolated students again. Inside I’m doing graceful cartwheels around

my head, knowing full well that’s the only place I can do graceful cartwheels. Kate stops

writing and puts her pen down. She glances across at me, and I catch her Cheshire cat

smile too.

We head back to our apartment together in her Mercedes, refusing to discuss our final

paper. Kate is more concerned about what she’s going to wear to the bar this evening. I

am busily fishing around in my purse for my keys.



“Ana, there’s a package for you.” Kate is standing on the steps up to the front door

holding a brown paper parcel. Odd. I haven’t ordered anything from Amazon recently.

Kate gives me the parcel and takes my keys to open the front door. It’s addressed to Miss

Anastasia Steele. There’s no sender’s address or name. Perhaps it’s from my mom or Ray.

“It’s probably from my folks.”

“Open it!” Kate is excited as she heads into the kitchen for our ‘Exams are finished

hurrah Champagne’.

I open the parcel, and inside I find a half leather box containing three seemingly identi-

cal old cloth-covered books in mint condition and a plain white card. Written on one side,

in black ink in neat cursive handwriting, is:

I recognize the quote from Tess. I am stunned by the irony as I’ve just spent three

hours writing about the novels of Thomas Hardy in my final examination. Perhaps there

is no irony… perhaps it’s deliberate. I inspect the books closely, three volumes of Tess of

the D’Urbervilles. I open the front cover. Written in an old typeface on the front plate is:

‘London: Jack R. Osgood, McIlvaine and Co., 1891.’

Holy shit - they are first editions. They must be worth a fortune, and I know immedi-

ately who’s sent them. Kate is at my shoulder gazing at the books. She picks up the card.

“First Editions,” I whisper.

“No.” Kate’s eyes are wide with disbelief. “Grey?”

I nod.

“Can’t think of anyone else.”

“What does this card mean?”

“I have no idea. I think it’s a warning – honestly he keeps warning me off. I have no

idea why. It’s not like I’m beating his door down.” I frown.

“I know you don’t want to talk about him, Ana, but he’s seriously into you. Warnings

or no.”

I have not let myself dwell on Christian Grey for the past week. Okay… so his gray

eyes are still haunting my dreams, and I know it will take an eternity to expunge the feel of

his arms around me and his wonderful fragrance from my brain. Why has he sent me this?

He told me that I wasn’t for him.

“I’ve found one Tess first edition for sale in New York at $14,000. But yours looks

in much better condition. They must have cost more.” Kate is consulting her good friend

Google.

“This quote – Tess says it to her mother after Alec D’Urberville has had his wicked

way with her.”

“I know,” muses Kate. “What is he trying to say?”

“I don’t know, and I don’t care. I can’t accept these from him. I’ll send them back with

an equally baffling quote from some obscure part of the book.”

“The bit where Angel Clare says fuck off?” Kate asks with a completely straight face.

“Yes, that bit.” I giggle. I love Kate, she’s so loyal and supportive. I repack the books

and leave them on the dining table. Kate hands me a glass of champagne.

“To the end of exams and our new life in Seattle,” she grins.

“To the end of exams, our new life in Seattle, and excellent results.” We clink glasses

and drink.

The bar is loud and hectic, full of soon to be graduates out to get trashed. José joins us. He

won’t graduate for another year, but he’s in the mood to party and gets us into the spirit of

our newfound freedom by buying a pitcher of margaritas for us all. As I down my fifth, I

know this is not a good idea on top of the champagne.

“So what now Ana?” José shouts at me over the noise.

“Kate and I are moving to Seattle. Kate’s parents have bought a condo there for her.”

“Dios mio, how the other half live. But you’ll be back for my show.”

“Of course, José, I wouldn’t miss it for the world.” I smile, and he puts his arm around

my waist and pulls me close.

“It means a lot to me that you’ll be there Ana,” he whispers in my ear. “Another mar-

garita?”

“José Luis Rodriguez – are you trying to get me drunk? Because I think it’s working.”

I giggle. “I think I’d better have a beer. I’ll go get us a pitcher.”

“More drink, Ana!” Kate bellows.

Kate has the constitution of an ox. She’s got her arm draped over Levi, one of our fel-

low English students and her usual photographer on her student newspaper. He’s given up

taking photos of the drunkenness that surrounds him. He only has eyes for Kate. She’s all

tiny camisole, tight jeans, and high heels, hair piled high with tendrils hanging down softly

around her face, her usual stunning self. Me, I’m more of a Converse and t-shirt kind of

girl, but I’m wearing my most flattering jeans. I move out of José’s hold and get up from

our table. Whoa. Head spin. I have to grab the back of the chair. Tequila based cocktails

are not a good idea.

I make my way to the bar and decide that I should visit the powder room while I am on

my feet. Good thinking, Ana. I stagger off through the crowd. Of course, there’s a line, but at least it’s quiet and cool in the corridor. I reach for my cell phone to relieve the boredom

of waiting in line. Hmm… Who did I last call? Was it José? Before that a number I don’t

recognize. Oh yes. Grey, I think this is his number. I giggle. I have no idea what the time

is, maybe I’ll wake him. Perhaps he can tell me why he sent me those books and the cryptic

message. If he wants me to stay away, he should leave me alone. I suppress a drunken grin

and hit the automatic re-dial. He answers on the second ring.

“Anastasia?” He’s surprised to hear from me. Well, frankly, I’m surprised to ring him.

Then my befuddled brain registers… how does he know it’s me?

“Why did you send me the books?” I slur at him.

“Anastasia, are you okay? You sound strange.” His voice is filled with concern.

“I’m not the strange one, you are,” I accuse. There - that told him, my courage fuelled

by alcohol.

“Anastasia, have you been drinking?”

“What’s it to you?”

“I’m – curious. Where are you?”

“In a bar.”

“Which bar?” He sounds exasperated.

“A bar in Portland.”

“How are you getting home?”

“I’ll find a way.” This conversation is not going how I expected.

“Which bar are you in?”

“Why did you send me the books, Christian?”

“Anastasia, where are you, tell me now.” His tone is so, so dictatorial, his usual control

freak. I imagine him as an old time movie director wearing jodhpurs, holding an old fash-

ioned megaphone and a riding crop. The image makes me laugh out loud.

“You’re so… domineering,” I giggle.

“Ana, so help me, where the fuck are you?”

Christian Grey is swearing at me. I giggle again. “I’m in Portland… s’a long way

from Seattle.”

“Where in Portland?”

“Goodnight, Christian.”

“Ana!”

I hang up. Ha! Though he didn’t tell me about the books. I frown. Mission not ac-

complished. I am really quite drunk - my head swims uncomfortably as I shuffle with the

line. Well, the object of the exercise was to get drunk. I have succeeded. This is what it’s

like – probably not an experience to be repeated. The line has moved, and it’s now my

turn. I stare blankly at the poster on the back of the toilet door that extols the virtues of

safe sex. Holy crap, did I just call Christian Grey? Shit. My phone rings and it makes me

jump. I yelp in surprise.

“Hi,” I bleat timidly in to the phone. I hadn’t reckoned on this.

“I’m coming to get you,” he says and hangs up. Only Christian Grey could sound so

calm and so threatening at the same time.

Holy crap. I pull my jeans up. My heart is thumping. Coming to get me? Oh no. I’m going to be sick… no… I’m fine. Hang on. He’s just messing with my head. I didn’t tell

him where I was. He can’t find me here. Besides, it will take him hours to get here from

Seattle, and we’ll be long gone by then. I wash my hands and check my face in the mirror.

I look flushed and slightly unfocused. Hmm… tequila.

I wait at the bar for what feels like an eternity for the pitcher of beer and eventually

return to the table.

“You’ve been gone so long.” Kate scolds me. “Where were you?”

“I was in line for the restroom.”

José and Levi are having some heated debate about our local baseball team. José

pauses in his tirade to pour us all beers, and I take a long sip.

“Kate, I think I’d better step outside and get some fresh air.”

“Ana, you are such a lightweight.”

“I’ll be five minutes.”

I make my way through the crowd again. I am beginning to feel nauseous, my head is

spinning uncomfortably, and I’m a little unsteady on my feet. More unsteady than usual.

Drinking in the cool evening air in the parking lot makes me realize how drunk I am.

My vision has been affected, and I’m really seeing double of everything like in old re-runs

of Tom and Jerry Cartoons. I think I’m going to be sick. Why did I let myself get this

messed up?

“Ana,” José has joined me. “You okay?”

“I think I’ve just had a bit too much to drink.” I smile weakly at him.

“Me too,” he murmurs, and his dark eyes are watching me intently. “Do you need a

hand?” he asks and steps closer, putting his arm around me.

“José I’m okay. I’ve got this.” I try and push him away rather feebly.

“Ana, please,” he whispers, and now he’s holding me in his arms, pulling me close.

“José, what you doing?”

“You know I like you Ana, please.” He has one hand at the small of my back holding

me against him, the other at my chin tipping back my head. Holy fuck… he’s going to kiss

me. “No José, stop – no.” I push him, but he’s a wall of hard muscle, and I cannot shift him.

His hand has slipped into my hair, and he’s holding my head in place.

“Please, Ana, cariña,” he whispers against my lips. His breath is soft and smells too

sweet – of margarita and beer. He gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my

mouth. I feel panicky, drunk, and out of control. The feeling is suffocating.

“José, no,” I plead. I don’t want this. You are my friend, and I think I’m going to throw

up. “I think the lady said no.” A voice in the dark says quietly. Holy shit! Christian Grey,

he’s here. How? José releases me.

“Grey,” he says tersely. I glance anxiously up at Christian. He’s glowering at José,

and he’s furious. Crap. My stomach heaves, and I double over, my body no longer able to

tolerate the alcohol, and I vomit spectacularly on to the ground.

“Ugh – Dios mio, Ana!” José jumps back in disgust. Grey grabs my hair and pulls it

out of the firing line and gently leads me over to a raised flowerbed on the edge of the park-

ing lot. I note, with deep gratitude, that it’s in relative darkness.

“If you’re going to throw up again, do it here. I’ll hold you.” He has one arm around

my shoulders – the other is holding my hair in a makeshift ponytail down my back so it’s

off my face. I try awkwardly to push him away, but I vomit again… and again. Oh shit…

how long is this going to last? Even when my stomach’s empty and nothing is coming up,

horrible dry heaves wrack my body. I vow silently that I’ll never ever drink again. This is

just too appalling for words. Finally, it stops.

My hands are resting on the brick wall of the flowerbed, barely holding me up - vomit-

ing profusely is exhausting. Grey takes his hands off me and passes me a handkerchief.

Only he would have a monogrammed, freshly laundered, linen handkerchief. CTG. I

didn’t know you could still buy these. Vaguely I wonder what the T stands for as I wipe

my mouth. I cannot bring myself to look at him. I’m swamped with shame, disgusted with

myself. I want to be swallowed up by the azaleas in the flowerbed and be anywhere but

here.José is still hovering by the entrance to the bar, watching us. I groan and put my head

in my hands. This has to be the single worst moment of my life. My head is still swimming

as I try to remember a worse one – and I can only come up with Christian’s rejection – and

this is so, so many shades darker in terms of humiliation. I risk a peek at him. He’s staring

down at me, his face composed, giving nothing away. Turning, I glance at José who looks

pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by Grey. I glare at him. I have a few

choice words for my so-called friend, none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey

CEO. Ana who are you kidding, he’s just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the

local flora. There’s no disguising your lack of ladylike behavior.

“I’ll err… see you inside,” José mutters, but we both ignore him, and he slinks off back

into the building. I’m on my own with Grey. Double crap. What should I say to him?

Apologize for the phone call.

“I’m sorry,” I mutter, staring at the handkerchief which I am furiously worrying with

my fingers. It’s so soft.

“What are you sorry for Anastasia?”

Oh crap, he wants his damned pound of flesh.

“The phone call mainly, being sick. Oh, the list is endless,” I murmur, feeling my skin

coloring up. Please, please can I die now?

“We’ve all been here, perhaps not quite as dramatically as you,” he says dryly. “It’s

about knowing your limits, Anastasia. I mean, I’m all for pushing limits, but really this is

beyond the pale. Do you make a habit of this kind of behavior?”

My head buzzes with excess alcohol and irritation. What the hell has it got to do with

him? I didn’t invite him here. He sounds like a middle-aged man scolding me like an er-

rant child. Part of me wants to say, if I want to get drunk every night like this, then it’s my

decision and nothing to do with him – but I’m not brave enough. Not now that I’ve thrown

up in front of him. Why is he still standing there?

“No,” I say contritely. “I’ve never been drunk before and right now I have no desire

to ever be again.”

I just don’t understand why he’s here. I begin to feel faint. He notices my dizziness and

grabs me before I fall and hoists me into his arms, holding me close to his chest like a child.

“Come on, I’ll take you home,” he murmurs.

“I need to tell Kate.” Holy Moses, I’m in his arms again.

“My brother can tell her.”

“What?”

“My brother Elliot is talking to Miss Kavanagh.”

“Oh?” I don’t understand.

“He was with me when you phoned.”

“In Seattle?” I’m confused.

“No, I’m staying at the Heathman.”

Still? Why?

“How did you find me?”

“I tracked your cell phone Anastasia.”

Oh, of course he did. How is that possible? Is it legal? Stalker, my subconscious

whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that’s still floating in my brain, but somehow,

because it’s him, I don’t mind.

“Do you have a jacket or a purse?”

“Err… yes, I came with both. Christian, please, I need to tell Kate. She’ll worry.” His

mouth presses into a hard line, and he sighs heavily.

“If you must.”

He sets me down, and, taking my hand, leads me back into the bar. I feel weak, still

drunk, embarrassed, exhausted, mortified, and on some strange level absolutely off the

scale thrilled. He’s clutching my hand – such a confusing array of emotions. I’ll need at

least a week to process them all.

It’s noisy, crowded, and the music has started so there is a large crowd on the dance

floor. Kate is not at our table, and José has disappeared. Levi looks lost and forlorn on his

own.“Where’s Kate?” I shout at Levi above the noise. My head is beginning to pound in

time to the thumping bass line of the music.

“Dancing,” Levi shouts, and I can tell he’s mad. He’s eyeing Christian suspiciously.

I struggle into my black jacket and place my small shoulder bag over my head so it sits at

my hip. I’m ready to go, once I’ve seen Kate.

“She’s on the dance floor,” I touch Christian’s arm and lean up and shout in his ear,

brushing his hair with my nose, smelling his clean, fresh smell. Oh my. All those forbid-

den, unfamiliar feelings that I have tried to deny surface and run amok through my drained

body. I flush, and somewhere deep, deep down my muscles clench deliciously.

He rolls his eyes at me and takes my hand again and leads me to the bar. He’s served

immediately, no waiting for Mr. Control-Freak Grey. Does everything come so easily to

him? I can’t hear what he orders. He hands me a very large glass of iced water.

“Drink,” he shouts his order at me.

The moving lights are twisting and turning in time to the music casting strange colored

light and shadows all over the bar and the clientele. He’s alternately green, blue, white, and

a demonic red. He’s watching me intently. I take a tentative sip.

“All of it,” he shouts.

He’s so overbearing. He runs his hand through his unruly hair. He looks frustrated,

angry. What is his problem? Apart from a silly drunk girl ringing him in the middle of the

night so he thinks she needs rescuing. And it turns out she does from her over amorous

friend. Then seeing her being violently ill at his feet. Oh Ana… are you ever going to live

this down? My subconscious is figuratively tutting and glaring at me over her half moon

specs. I sway slightly, and he puts his hand on my shoulder to steady me. I do as I’m told

and drink the entire glass. It makes me feel queasy. Taking the glass from me, he places it

on the bar. I notice through a blur what he’s wearing; a loose white linen shirt, snug jeans,

black Converse sneakers, and a dark pinstriped jacket. His shirt is unbuttoned at the top,

and I see a sprinkling of hair in the gap. In my groggy frame of mind, he looks yummy.

He takes my hand once more. Holy cow – he’s leading me onto the dance floor. Shit.

I do not dance. He can sense my reluctance, and under the colored lights, I can see his

amused, slightly sardonic smile. He gives my hand a sharp tug, and I’m in his arms again,

and he starts to move, taking me with him. Boy, he can dance, and I can’t believe that I’m

following him step for step. Maybe it’s because I’m drunk that I can keep up. He’s hold-

ing me tight against him, his body against mine… if he wasn’t clutching me so tightly, I’m

sure I would swoon at his feet. In the back of my mind, my mother’s often-recited warning

comes to me: Never trust a man who can dance.

He moves us through the crowded throng of dancers to the other side of the dance floor,

and we are beside Kate and Elliot, Christian’s brother. The music is pounding away, loud

and leery, outside and inside my head. I gasp. Kate is making her moves. She’s dancing

her ass off, and she only ever does that if she likes someone. Really likes someone. It

means there’ll be three of us for breakfast tomorrow morning. Kate!

Christian leans over and shouts in Elliot’s ear. I cannot hear what he says. Elliot is

tall with wide shoulders, curly blonde hair, and light, wickedly gleaming eyes. I can’t tell

the color under the pulsating heat of the flashing lights. Elliot grins, and pulls Kate into

his arms, where she is more than happy to be… Kate! Even in my inebriated state, I am

shocked. She’s only just met him. She nods at whatever Elliot says and grins at me and

waves. Christian propels us off the dance floor in double quick time.

But I never got to talk to her. Is she okay? I can see where things are heading for her

and him. I need to do the safe sex lecture. In the back of my mind, I hope she reads one of

the posters on the back of the toilet doors. My thoughts crash through my brain, fighting

the drunk, fuzzy feeling. It’s so warm in here, so loud, so colorful – too bright. My head

begins to swim, oh no… and I can feel the floor coming up to meet my face or so it feels.

The last thing I hear before I pass out in Christian Grey’s arms is his harsh epithet.

“Fuck!”



It’s very quiet. The light is muted. I am comfortable and warm, in this bed. Hmm… I

open my eyes, and for a moment, I’m tranquil and serene, enjoying the strange unfamiliar

surroundings. I have no idea where I am. The headboard behind me is in the shape of

a massive sun. It’s oddly familiar. The room is large and airy and plushly furnished in

browns and golds and beige. I have seen it before. Where? My befuddled brain struggles

through its recent visual memories. Holy crap. I’m in the Heathman hotel… in a suite. I

have stood in a room similar to this with Kate. This looks bigger. Oh shit. I’m in Christian

Grey’s suite. How did I get here?

Fractured memories of the previous night come slowly back to haunt me. The drink-

ing, oh no the drinking, the phone call, oh no the phone call, the vomiting, oh no the vomiting. José and then Christian. Oh no. I cringe inwardly. I don’t remember coming here.

I’m wearing my t-shirt, bra, and panties. No socks. No jeans. Holy shit.

I glance at the bedside table. On it is a glass of orange juice and two tablets. Advil.

Control freak that he is, he thinks of everything. I sit up and take the tablets. Actually, I

don’t feel that bad, probably much better than I deserve. The orange juice tastes divine.

It’s thirst quenching and refreshing. Nothing beats freshly squeezed orange juice for reviv-

ing an arid mouth.

There’s a knock on the door. My heart leaps into my mouth, and I can’t seem to find

my voice. He opens the door anyway and strolls in.

Holy hell, he’s been working out. He’s in gray sweat pants that hang, in that way, off

his hips and a gray singlet, which is dark with sweat, like his hair. Christian Grey’s sweat,

the notion does odd things to me. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. I feel like a two-

year old, if I close my eyes then I’m not really here.

“Good morning Anastasia. How are you feeling?”

Oh no.

“Better than I deserve,” I mumble.

I peek up at him. He places a large shopping bag on a chair and grasps each end of the

towel that he has around his neck. He’s staring at me, gray eyes dark, and as usual, I have

no idea what he’s thinking. He hides his thoughts and feelings so well.

“How did I get here?” My voice is small, contrite.

He comes and sits down on the edge of the bed. He’s close enough for me to touch, for

me to smell. Oh my… sweat and body wash and Christian, it’s a heady cocktail - so much

better than a margarita, and now I can speak from experience.

“After you passed out, I didn’t want to risk the leather upholstery in my car taking you

all the way to your apartment. So I brought you here,” he says phlegmatically.

“Did you put me to bed?”

“Yes.” His face is impassive.

“Did I throw up again?” My voice is quieter.

“No.”

“Did you undress me?” I whisper.

“Yes.” He quirks an eyebrow at me as I blush furiously.

“We didn’t,” I whisper, my mouth drying in mortified horror as I can’t complete the

question. I stare at my hands.

“Anastasia, you were comatose. Necrophilia is not my thing. I like my women sen-

tient and receptive,” he says dryly.

“I’m so sorry.”

His mouth lifts slightly in a wry smile.

“It was a very diverting evening. Not one that I’ll forget in a while.”

Me neither – oh he’s laughing at me, the bastard. I didn’t ask him to come and get me.

Somehow I’ve been made to feel like the villain of the piece.

“You didn’t have to track me down with whatever James Bond stuff you’re developing

for the highest bidder,” I snap at him. He stares at me, surprised, and if I’m not mistaken,

a little wounded.

“Firstly, the technology to track cell phones is available over the Internet. Secondly,

my company does not invest or manufacture any kind of surveillance devices, and thirdly,

if I hadn’t come to get you, you’d probably be waking up in the photographer’s bed, and

from what I can remember, you weren’t overly enthused about him pressing his suit,” he

says acidly.

Pressing his suit! I glance up at Christian, he’s glaring at me, his gray eyes blazing,

aggrieved. I try to bite my lip, but I fail to repress my laughter.

“Which medieval chronicle did you escape from?” I giggle. “You sound like a courtly

knight.”

His mood visibly shifts. His eyes soften and his expression warms, and I see a trace of

a smile on his beautifully chiseled lips.

“Anastasia, I don’t think so. Dark knight maybe.” His smile is sardonic, and he shakes

his head. “Did you eat last night?” His tone is accusatory. I shake my head. What major

transgression have I committed now? His jaw clenches, but his face remains impassive.

“You need to eat. That’s why you were so ill. Honestly Anastasia, it’s drinking rule

number one.” He runs this hand through his hair, and I know it’s because he’s exasperated.

“Are you going to continue to scold me?”

“Is that what I’m doing?”

“I think so.”

“You’re lucky I’m just scolding you.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, if you were mine, you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt

you pulled yesterday. You didn’t eat, you got drunk, you put yourself at risk.” He closes his

eyes, dread etched on his lovely face, and he shudders slightly. When he opens his eyes,

he glares at me. “I hate to think what could have happened to you.”

I scowl back at him. What is his problem? What’s it to him? If I was his… well I’m

not. Though maybe, part of me would like to be. The thought pierces through the irritation

I feel at his high-handed words. I flush at the waywardness of my subconscious - she’s do-

ing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.

“I would have been fine. I was with Kate.”

“And the photographer?” he snaps at me.

Hmm… young José. I’ll need to face him at some point.

“José just got out of line.” I shrug.

“Well the next time he gets out of line, maybe someone should teach him some man-

ners.”

“You are quite the disciplinarian,” I hiss at him.

“Oh, Anastasia, you have no idea.” His eyes narrow, and then he grins wickedly. It’s

disarming. One minute, I’m confused and angry, the next I’m gazing at his gorgeous smile.

Wow… I am entranced, and it’s because his smile is so rare. I quite forget what he’s talk-

ing about.

“I’m going to have a shower. Unless you’d like to shower first?” He cocks his head

to one side, still grinning. My heartbeat has picked up, and my medulla oblongata has ne-

glected to fire any synapses to make me breathe. His grin widens, and he reaches over and

runs his thumb down my cheek and across my lower lip.

“Breathe, Anastasia,” he whispers and rises. “Breakfast will be here in fifteen minutes.

You must be famished.” He heads into the bathroom and closes the door.

I let out the breath that I’ve been holding. Why is he so damned attractive? Right

now I want to go and join him in the shower. I have never felt this way about anyone. My

hormones are racing. My skin tingles where his thumb traced over my face and lower lip.

I feel like squirming with a needy, achy… discomfort. I don’t understand this reaction.

Hmm… Desire. This is desire. This is what it feels like.

I lie back on the soft feather filled pillows. ‘If you were mine.’ Oh my – what would I

do to be his? He’s the only man who has ever set my blood racing around my body. Yet,

he’s so antagonizing too; he’s difficult, complicated, and confusing. One minute he rebuffs

me, the next he sends me fourteen-thousand-dollar books, then he tracks me like a stalker.

And for all that, I have spent the night in his hotel suite, and I feel safe. Protected. He cares

enough to come and rescue me from some mistakenly perceived danger. He’s not a dark

knight at all, but a white knight in shining, dazzling armor – a classic romantic hero – Sir

Gawain or Lancelot.

I scramble out of his bed frantically searching for my jeans. He emerges from the bath-

room wet and glistening from the shower, still unshaven, with just a towel around his waist,

and there am I – all bare legs and awkward gawkiness. He’s surprised to see me out of bed.

“If you’re looking for your jeans, I’ve sent them to the laundry.” His gaze is a dark

obsidian. “They were spattered with your vomit.”

“Oh.” I flush scarlet. Why oh why does he always catch me on the back foot?

“I sent Taylor out for another pair and some shoes. They’re in the bag on the chair.”

Clean clothes. What an unexpected bonus.

“Um… I’ll have a shower,” I mutter. “Thanks.” What else can I say? I grab the bag

and dart into the bathroom away from the unnerving proximity of naked Christian. Michel-

angelo’s David has nothing on him.

In the bathroom, it’s all hot and steamy from where he’s been showering. I strip off

my clothes and quickly clamber into the shower anxious to be under the cleansing stream

of water. It cascades over me, and I hold up my face into the welcoming torrent. I want

Christian Grey. I want him badly. Simple fact. For the first time in my life, I want to go

to bed with a man. I want to feel his hands and his mouth on me.

He said he likes his women sentient. He’s probably not celibate then. But he’s not

made a pass at me, unlike Paul or José. I don’t understand. Does he want me? He

wouldn’t kiss me last week. Am I repellent to him? And yet, I’m here and he brought me

here. I just don’t know what his game is? What he’s thinking? You’ve slept in his bed all

night, and he’s not touched you Ana. You do the math. My subconscious has reared her

ugly, snide head. I ignore her.

The water is warm and soothing. Hmm… I could stay under this shower, in his bath-

room, forever. I reach for the body-wash and it smells of him. It’s a delicious smell. I rub

it all over myself, fantasizing that it’s him - him rubbing this heavenly scented soap into

my body, across my breasts, over my stomach, between my thighs with his long fingered

hands. Oh my. My heartbeat picks up again, this feels so… so good.

“Breakfast is here.” He knocks on the door, startling me.

“Okay,” I stutter as I’m yanked cruelly out of my erotic daydream.

I climb out of the shower and grab two towels. I put my hair in one and wrap it Carmen

Miranda style on my head. Hastily, I dry myself, ignoring the pleasurable feel of the towel

rubbing against my over-sensitized skin.

I inspect the bag of jeans. Not only has Taylor brought me jeans and new Converse,

but a pale blue shirt, socks, and underwear. Oh my. A clean bra and panties – actually to

describe them in such a mundane, utilitarian way does not do them justice. They are an

exquisite design of some fancy European lingerie. All pale blue lace and finery. Wow. I

am in awe and slightly daunted by this underwear. . What’s more, they fit perfectly. But of

course they do. I flush to think of the Buzz-Cut man in some lingerie store buying this for

me. I wonder what else is in his job description.

I dress quickly. The rest of the clothing is a perfect fit. I brusquely towel-dry my hair

and try desperately to bring it under control. But, as usual, it refuses to cooperate, and my

only option is to restrain it with a hair tie. I shall search in my purse, when I find it. I take

a deep breath. Time to face Mr. Confusing.

I’m relieved to find the bedroom empty. I hunt quickly for my purse – but it’s not in

here. Taking another deep breath, I enter the living area of the suite. It’s huge. There’s an

opulent, plush seating area, all overstuffed couches and soft cushions, an elaborate coffee

table with a stack of large glossy books, a study area with a top-of-the-range Mac, an enor-

mous plasma screen TV on the wall, and Christian is sitting at a dining table on the other

side of the room reading a newspaper. It’s the size of a tennis court or something, not that

I play tennis, though I have watched Kate a few times. Kate!

“Crap, Kate,” I croak. Christian peers up at me.

“She knows you’re here and still alive. I texted Elliot,” he says with just a trace of

humor.

Oh no. I remember her fervent dancing of the night before. All her patented moves

used with maximum effect to seduce Christian’s brother no less! What’s she going to think

about me being here? I’ve never stayed out before. She’s still with Elliot. She’s only done

this twice before, and both times I’ve had to endure the hideous pink PJs for a week from

the fallout. She’s going to think I’ve had a one-night stand too.

Christian stares at me imperiously. He’s wearing a white linen shirt, collar and cuffs

undone.

“Sit,” he commands, pointing to a place at the table. I make my way across the room

and sit down opposite him as I’ve been directed. The table is laden with food.

“I didn’t know what you liked, so I ordered a selection from the breakfast menu.” He

gives me a crooked, apologetic smile.

“That’s very profligate of you,” I murmur, bewildered by the choice, though I am hun-

gry. “Yes, it is.” He sounds guilty.

I opt for pancakes, maple syrup, scrambled eggs, and bacon. Christian tries to hide a

smile as he returns to his egg white omelet. The food is delicious.

“Tea?” he asks.

“Yes, please.”

He passes me a small teapot of hot water and on the saucer is a Twining’s English

Breakfast teabag. Jeez, he remembers how I like my tea.

“Your hair’s very damp,” he scolds.

“I couldn’t find the hairdryer,” I mutter, embarrassed. Not that I looked.

Christian’s mouth presses into a hard line, but he doesn’t say anything.

“Thank you for organizing the clothes.”

“It’s a pleasure, Anastasia. That color suits you.”

I blush and stare down at my fingers.

“You know, you really should learn to take a compliment.” His tone is castigating.

“I should give you some money for these clothes.”

He glares at me as if I have offended him on some level. I hurry on.

“You’ve already given me the books, which, of course, I can’t accept. But these

clothes, please let me pay you back.” I smile tentatively at him.

“Anastasia, trust me, I can afford it.”

“That’s not the point. Why should you buy these for me?”

“Because I can,” his eyes flash with a wicked gleam.

“Just because you can doesn’t mean that you should,” I reply quietly as he arches an

eyebrow at me, his eyes twinkling, and suddenly I feel that we’re talking about something

else, but I don’t know what it is. Which reminds me…

“Why did you send me the books, Christian?” My voice is soft. He puts down his

cutlery and regards me intently, his gray eyes burning with some unfathomable emotion.

Holy crap – my mouth dries.

“Well, when you were nearly run over by the cyclist – and I was holding you and you

were looking up at me – all kiss me, kiss me, Christian,” he pauses and shrugs slightly, “I

felt I owed you an apology and a warning.” He runs his hand through his hair. “Anastasia,

I’m not a hearts and flowers kind of man, I don’t do romance. My tastes are very singular.

You should steer clear from me.” He closes his eyes as if in defeat. “There’s something

about you, though, and I’m finding it impossible to stay away. But I think you’ve figured

that out already.”

My appetite vanishes. He can’t stay away!

“Then don’t,” I whisper.

He gasps, his eyes wide.

“You don’t know what you’re saying.”

“Enlighten me, then.”

We sit gazing at each other, neither of us touching our food.

“You’re not celibate then?” I breathe.

Amusement lights up his gray eyes.

“No, Anastasia, I’m not celibate.” He pauses for this information to sink in, and I flush

scarlet. The mouth-to-brain filter is broken again. I can’t believe I’ve just said that out

loud.“What are your plans for the next few days?” he asks, his voice low.

“I’m working today, from midday. What is the time?” I panic suddenly.

“It’s just after ten, you’ve plenty of time. What about tomorrow?” He has his elbows

on the table, and his chin is resting on his long steepled fingers.

“Kate and I are going to start packing. We’re moving to Seattle next weekend, and I’m

working at Clayton’s all this week.”

“You have a place in Seattle already?”

“Yes.”

“Where?”

“I can’t remember the address. It’s in the Pike Market District.”

“Not far from me,” his lips twitch up in a half smile. “So what are you going to do for

work in Seattle?”

Where is he going with all these questions? The Christian Grey Inquisition is almost

as irritating as the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition.

“I’ve applied for some internships. I’m waiting to hear.”

“Have you applied to my company as I suggested?”

I flush… of course not.

“Um… no.”

“And what’s wrong with my company?”

“Your company or your Company?” I smirk.

He smiles slightly.

“Are you smirking at me, Miss Steele?” He cocks his head to one side, and I think he

looks amused, but it’s hard to tell. I flush and glance down at my unfinished breakfast. I

can’t look him in the eye when he uses that tone of voice.

“I’d like to bite that lip,” he whispers darkly.

Oh my. I am completely unaware that I am chewing my bottom lip. My mouth pops

open as I gasp and swallow at the same time. That has to be the sexiest thing anybody has

ever said to me. My heart beat spikes, and I think I’m panting. Jeez, I’m a quivering, moist

mess, and he hasn’t even touched me. I squirm in my seat and meet his dark glare.

“Why don’t you?” I challenge quietly.

“Because I’m not going to touch you Anastasia - not until I have your written consent

to do so.” His lips hint at a smile.

What?

“What does that mean?”

“Exactly what I say.” He sighs and shakes his head at me, amused, but exasperated too.

“I need to show you, Anastasia. What time do you finish work this evening?”

“About eight.”

“Well, we could go to Seattle this evening or next Saturday for dinner at my place, and

I’ll acquaint you with the facts then. The choice is yours.”

“Why can’t you tell me now?” I sound petulant.

“Because I’m enjoying my breakfast and your company. Once you’re enlightened, you

probably won’t want to see me again.”

Holy shit. What does that mean? Does he white-slave small children to some God-

forsaken part of the planet? Is he part of some underworld crime syndicate? It would ex-

plain why he’s so rich. Is he deeply religious? Is he impotent? Surely not, he could prove

that to me right now. Oh my. I flush scarlet thinking about the possibilities. This is getting me nowhere. I’d like to solve the riddle that is Christian Grey sooner rather than later. If it

means that whatever secret he has is so gross that I don’t want to know him any more then,

quite frankly, it will be a relief. Don’t lie to yourself – my subconscious yells at me– it’ll

have to be pretty bloody bad to have you running for the hills.

“Tonight.”

He raises an eyebrow.

“Like Eve, you’re so quick to eat from the tree of knowledge,” he smirks.

“Are you smirking at me, Mr. Grey?” I ask sweetly. Pompous ass.

He narrows his eyes at me and picks up his BlackBerry. He presses one number.

“Taylor. I’m going to need Charlie Tango.”

Charlie Tango! Who’s he?

“From Portland at say twenty-thirty... No, standby at Escala… All night.”

All night!

“Yes. On call tomorrow morning. I’ll pilot from Portland to Seattle.”

Pilot?

“Standby pilot from twenty-two-thirty.” He puts the phone down. No please or thank

you.“Do people always do what you tell them?”

“Usually, if they want to keep their jobs,” he says, deadpan.

“And if they don’t work for you?”

“Oh, I can be very persuasive, Anastasia. You should finish your breakfast. And then

I’ll drop you home. I’ll pick you up at Clayton’s at eight when you finish. We’ll fly up to

Seattle.”

I blink at him rapidly.

“Fly?”

“Yes. I have a helicopter.”

I gape at him. I have my second date with Christian oh-so-mysterious Grey. From

coffee to helicopter rides. Wow.

“We’ll go by helicopter to Seattle?”

“Yes.”

“Why?”

He grins wickedly.

“Because I can. Finish your breakfast.”

How can I eat now? I’m going to Seattle by helicopter with Christian Grey. And he

wants to bite my lip… I squirm at the thought

“Eat,” he says more sharply. “Anastasia, I have an issue with wasted food… eat.”

“I can’t eat all this.” I gape at what’s left on the table.

“Eat what’s on your plate. If you’d eaten properly yesterday, you wouldn’t be here, and

I wouldn’t be declaring my hand so soon.” His mouth sets in a grim line. He looks angry.

I frown and return to my now cold food. I’m too excited to eat, Christian. Don’t you

understand? My subconscious explains. But I’m too much of a coward to voice these

thoughts aloud, especially when he looks so sullen. Hmm, like a small boy. I find the

thought amusing.

“What’s so funny?” he asks. I shake my head, not daring tell him and keep my eyes

on my food. Swallowing my last piece of pancake, I peek up at him. He’s eyeing me

speculatively.

“Good girl,” he says. “I’ll take you home when you’ve dried your hair. I don’t want

you getting ill.” There’s some kind of unspoken promise in his words. What does he

mean? I leave the table, wondering for a moment if I should ask permission but dismissing

the idea. Sounds like a dangerous precedent to set. I head back to his bedroom. A thought

stops me.

“Where did you sleep last night?” I turn to gaze at him still sitting in the dining room

chair. I can’t see any blankets or sheets out here – perhaps he’s had them tidied away.

“In my bed,” he says simply, his gaze impassive again.

“Oh.”

“Yes, it was quite a novelty for me too.” He smiles.

“Not having… sex.” There – I said the word. I blush – of course.

“No,” he shakes his head and frowns as if recalling something uncomfortable. “Sleep-

ing with someone.” He picks up his newspaper and continues to read.

What in heaven’s name does that mean? He’s never slept with anyone? He’s a vir-

gin? Somehow I doubt that. I stand staring at him in disbelief. He is the most mystifying

person I’ve ever met. And it dawns on me that I have slept with Christian Grey, and I kick

myself – what would I have given to be conscious to watch him sleep. See him vulnerable.

Somehow, I find that hard to imagine. Well, allegedly all will be revealed tonight.

In his bedroom, I hunt through a chest of drawers and find the hair dryer. Using my

fingers, I dry my hair the best I can. When I’ve finished, I head into the bathroom. I want

to clean my teeth. I eye Christian’s toothbrush. It would be like having him in my mouth.

Hmm… Glancing guiltily over my shoulder at the door, I feel the bristles on the toothbrush.

They are damp. He must have used it already. Grabbing it quickly, I squirt toothpaste on

it and brush my teeth in double quick time. I feel so naughty. It’s such a thrill.

Grabbing my t-shirt, bra, and panties from yesterday, I put them in the shopping bag

that Taylor brought and head back to the living area to hunt for my bag and jacket. Deep

joy, there is a hair tie in my bag. Christian is watching me as I tie my hair into a ponytail,

his expression unreadable. I feel his eyes follow me as I sit down and wait for him to finish.

He’s on his BlackBerry talking to someone.

“They want two?… How much will that cost?... Okay, and what safety measures do we

have in place?… And they’ll go via Suez?… How safe is Ben Sudan?... And when do they

arrive in Darfur?... Okay, let’s do it. Keep me abreast of progress.” He hangs up.

“Ready to go?”

I nod. I wonder what his conversation was about. He slips on a navy pinstriped jacket,

picks up his car keys, and heads for the door.

“After you, Miss Steele,” he murmurs, opening the door for me. He looks so casually

elegant.

I pause, fractionally too long, drinking in the sight of him. And to think I slept with

him last night and, after all the tequila and the throwing up, he’s still here. What’s more, he

wants to take me to Seattle. Why me? I don’t understand it. I head out the door recalling

his words – There’s something about you – Well the feeling is entirely mutual Mr. Grey,

and I aim to find out what it is.

We walk in silence down the corridor toward the elevator. As we wait, I peek up at

him through my lashes, and he looks out of the corner of his eyes down at me. I smile, and

his lips twitch.

The elevator arrives, and we step in. We’re alone. Suddenly, for some inexplica-

ble reason, possibly our proximity in such an enclosed space, the atmosphere between us

changes, charging with an electric, exhilarating anticipation. My breathing alters as my

heart races. His head turns fractionally toward me, his eyes darkest slate. I bite my lip.

“Oh, fuck the paperwork,” he growls. He lunges at me, pushing me against the wall

of the elevator. Before I know it, he’s got both of my hands in one of his in a vice-like grip

above my head, and he’s pinning me to the wall using his hips. Holy shit. His other hand

grabs my ponytail and yanks down, bringing my face up, and his lips are on mine. It’s

only just not painful. I moan into his mouth, giving his tongue an opening. He takes full

advantage, his tongue expertly exploring my mouth. I have never been kissed like this.

My tongue tentatively strokes his and joins his in a slow erotic dance that’s all about touch

and sensation, all bump and grind. He brings his hand up to grasp my chin and holds me

in place. I am helpless, my hands pinned, my face held, and his hips restraining me. . I feel

his erection against my belly. Oh my… He wants me. Christian Grey, Greek god, wants

me, and I want him, here… now, in the elevator.

“You. Are. So. Sweet,” he murmurs, each word a staccato.

The elevator stops, the doors open, and he pushes away from me in the blink of an eye,

leaving me hanging. Three men in business suits look at both of us and smirk as they climb

on board. My heart rate is through the roof, I feel like I’ve run an uphill race. I want to

lean over and grasp my knees… but that’s just too obvious.

I glance up at him. He looks so cool and calm, like he’s been doing the Seattle Times

crossword. How unfair. Is he totally unaffected by my presence? He glances at me out

of the corner of his eye, and he gently blows out a deep breath. Oh, he’s affected all right

– and my very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba. The businessmen

exit on the second floor. We have one more floor to travel.

“You’ve brushed your teeth,” he says, staring at me.

“I used your toothbrush,” I breathe.

His lips quirk up in a half smile.

“Oh, Anastasia Steele, what am I going to do with you?”

The doors open at the first floor, and he takes my hand and pulls me out.

“What is it about elevators?” he mutters, more to himself than to me as he strides

across the lobby. I struggle to keep pace with him because my wits have been thoroughly,

royally, scattered all over the floor and walls of elevator three in the Heathman Hotel.



Christian opens the passenger door to the black Audi SUV, and I clamber in. It’s a beast of

a car. He hasn’t mentioned the outburst of passion that exploded in the elevator. Should

I? Should we talk about it or pretend that it didn’t happen? It hardly seems real, my first

proper no-holds-barred kiss. As time ticks on, I assign it mythical, Arthurian legend, Lost

City of Atlantis status. It never happened, it never existed. Perhaps I imagined it all. No.

I touch my lips, swollen from his kiss. It definitely happened. I am a changed woman. I

want this man, desperately, and he wanted me.

I glance at him. Christian is his usual polite, slightly distant self.

How confusing.

He starts the engine and reverses out of his space in the parking lot. He switches on the

MP3 player. The car interior is filled with the sweetest, most magical music of two women

singing. Oh wow… all my senses are in disarray, so this is doubly affecting. It sends deli-

cious shivers up my spine. Christian pulls out on to SW Park Avenue, and he drives with

easy, lazy confidence.

“What are we listening to?”

“It’s the Flower Duet by Delibes, from the opera Lakmé. Do you like it?”

“Christian, it’s wonderful.”

“It is, isn’t it?” he grins, glancing at me. And for a fleeting moment, he seems his age;

young, carefree, and heart-stoppingly beautiful. Is this the key to him? Music? I sit and

listen to the angelic voices, teasing and seducing me.

“Can I hear that again?”

“Of course.” Christian pushes a button, and the music is caressing me once more. It’s

a gentle, slow, sweet, and sure assault on my aural senses.

“You like classical music?” I ask, hoping for a rare insight into his personal prefer-

ences.

“My taste is eclectic, Anastasia, everything from Thomas Tallis to the Kings of Leon.

It depends on my mood. You?”

“Me too. Though I don’t know who Thomas Tallis is.”

He turns and gazes at me briefly before his eyes are back on the road.

“I’ll play it for you sometime. He’s a sixteenth century British composer. Tudor,

church choral music.” Christian grins at me. “Sounds very esoteric, I know, but it’s also

magical, Anastasia.”

He presses a button, and the Kings of Leon start singing. Hmm… this I know. Sex on

Fire. How appropriate. The music is interrupted by the sound of a cell phone ringing over

the MP3 speakers. Christian hits a button on the steering wheel.

“Grey,” he snaps. He’s so brusque.

“Mr. Grey, it’s Welch here. I have the information you require.” A rasping, disembod-

ied voice comes over the speakers.

“Good. Email it to me. Anything to add?”

“No sir.”

He presses the button, then the call ceases and the music is back. No goodbye or

thanks. I’m so glad that I never seriously entertained the thought of working for him. I

shudder at the very idea. He’s just too controlling and cold with his employees. The music

cuts off again for the phone.

“Grey.”

“The NDA has been emailed to you, Mr. Grey.” A woman’s voice.

“Good. That’s all, Andrea.”

“Good day, sir.”

Christian hangs up by pressing a button on the steering wheel. The music is on very

briefly when the phone rings again. Holy hell, is this his life, constant nagging phone calls?

“Grey,” he snaps.

“Hi, Christian, d’you get laid?”

“Hello, Elliot – I’m on speaker phone, and I’m not alone in the car,” Christian sighs.

“Who’s with you?”

Christian rolls his eyes.

“Anastasia Steele.”

“Hi, Ana!”

Ana!

“Hello, Elliot.”

“Heard a lot about you,” Elliot murmurs huskily. Christian frowns.

“Don’t believe a word Kate says.”

Elliot laughs.

“I’m dropping Anastasia off now.” Christian emphasizes my name. “Shall I pick you

up?”“Sure.”

“See you shortly.” Christian hangs up, and the music is back.

“Why do you insist on calling me Anastasia?”

“Because it’s your name.”

“I prefer Ana.”

“Do you now?” he murmurs.

We are almost at my apartment. It’s not taken long.

“Anastasia,” he muses. I scowl at him, but he ignores my expression. “What happened

in the elevator - it won’t happen again, well, not unless it’s premeditated.”

He pulls up outside my duplex. I belatedly realize he’s not asked me where I live - yet

he knows. But then he sent the books, of course he knows where I live. What able, cell-

phone-tracking, helicopter owning, stalker wouldn’t.

Why won’t he kiss me again? I pout at the thought. I don’t understand. Honestly,

his surname should be Cryptic, not Grey. He climbs out of the car, walking with easy,

long-legged grace round to my side to open the door, ever the gentleman - except perhaps

in rare, precious moments in elevators. I flush at the memory of his mouth on mine, and

the thought that I’d been unable to touch him enters my mind. I wanted to run my fingers

through his decadent, untidy hair, but I’d been unable to move my hands. I am retrospec-

tively frustrated.

“I liked what happened in the elevator,” I murmur as I climb out of the car. I’m not sure

if I hear an audible gasp, but I choose to ignore it and head up the steps to the front door.

Kate and Elliot are sitting at our dining table. The fourteen-thousand-dollar books

have disappeared. Thank heavens. I have plans for them. She has the most un-Kate ridicu-

lous grin on her face, and she looks mussed up in a sexy kind of way. Christian follows me

into the living area, and in spite of her I’ve-been-having-a-good-time-all-night grin, Kate

eyes him suspiciously.

“Hi Ana.” She leaps up to hug me, then holds me at arm’s length so she can examine

me. She frowns and turns to Christian.

“Good morning, Christian,” she says, and her tone is a little hostile.

“Miss Kavanagh,” he says in his stiff formal way.

“Christian, her name is Kate,” Elliot grumbles.

“Kate.” Christian gives her a polite nod and glares at Elliot who grins and rises to hug

me too.

“Hi, Ana,” he smiles, his blue eyes twinkling, and I like him immediately. He’s obvi-

ously nothing like Christian, but then they’re adopted brothers.

“Hi, Elliot,” I smile at him, and I’m aware that I’m biting my lip.

“Elliot, we’d better go.” Christian says mildly.

“Sure.” He turns to Kate and pulls her into his arms and gives her a long lingering kiss.

Jeez… get a room. I stare at my feet, embarrassed. I glance up at Christian, and he’s

watching me intently. I narrow my eyes at him. Why can’t you kiss me like that? Elliot

continues to kiss Kate, sweeping her off her feet and dipping her in a dramatic hold so that

her hair touches the ground as he kisses her hard.

“Laters, baby,” he grins.

Kate just melts. I’ve never seen her melt before – the words comely and compliant

come to mind. Compliant Kate, boy, Elliot must be good. Christian rolls his eyes and

stares down at me, his expression unreadable, although maybe he’s mildly amused. He

tucks a stray strand of my hair that has worked its way free from my ponytail behind my

ear. My breath hitches at the contact, and I lean my head slightly into his fingers. His eyes

soften, and he runs his thumb across my lower lip. My blood sears in my veins. And all

too quickly, his touch is gone.

“Laters, baby,” he murmurs, and I have to laugh because it’s so unlike him. But even

though I know he’s being irreverent, the endearment tugs at something deep inside me.

“I’ll pick you up at eight.” He turns to leave, opening the front door and stepping out

on to the porch. Elliot follows him to the car but turns and blows Kate another kiss, and I

feel an unwelcome pang of jealousy.

“So, did you?” Kate asks as we watch them climb into the car and drive off, the burning

curiosity evident in her voice.

“No,” I snap irritably, hoping that will halt the questions. We head back into the apart-

ment. “You obviously did, though.” I can’t contain my envy. Kate always manages to

ensnare men. She is irresistible, beautiful, sexy, funny, forward… all the things that I’m

not. But her answering grin is infectious.

“And I’m seeing him again this evening.” She claps her hands and jumps up and down

like a small child. She cannot contain her excitement and happiness, and I can’t help but

feel happy for her. A happy Kate… this is going to be interesting.

“Christian is taking me to Seattle this evening.”

“Seattle?”

“Yes.”

“Maybe you will then?”

“Oh, I hope so.”

“You like him then?”

“Yes.”

“Like him enough to… ?”

“Yes.”

She raises her eyebrows.

“Wow. Ana Steele, finally falling for a man, and it’s Christian Grey – hot, sexy bil-

lionaire.”

“Oh yeah – it’s all about the money.” I smirk, and we both fall into a fit of giggles.

“Is that a new blouse?” she asks, and I let her have all the unexciting details about my

night.

“Has he kissed you yet?” she asks as she makes coffee.

I blush.

“Once.”

“Once!” she scoffs.

I nod, rather shame faced.

“He’s very reserved.”

She frowns.

“That’s odd.”

“I don’t think odd covers it really,” I murmur.

“We need to make sure you’re simply irresistible for this evening,” she says with de-

termination.

Oh no… this sounds like it will be time consuming, humiliating, and painful.

“I have to be at work in an hour.”

“I can work with that timeframe. Come on.” Kate grabs my hand and takes me into

her bedroom.

The day drags at Clayton’s even though we’re busy. We’ve hit the summer season, so I

have to spend two hours restocking the shelves once the shop is closed. It’s mindless work,

and it gives me too much time to think. I’ve not really had a chance all day.

Under Kate’s tireless and frankly intrusive instruction, my legs and underarms are

shaved to perfection, my eyebrows plucked, and I am buffed all over. It has been a most

unpleasant experience. But she assures me that this is what men expect these days. What

else will he expect? I have to convince Kate that this is what I want to do. For some

strange reason, she doesn’t trust him, maybe because he’s so stiff and formal. She says she

can’t put her finger on it, but I have promised to text her when I arrive in Seattle. I haven’t

told her about the helicopter, she’d freak.

I also have the José issue. He’s left three messages and seven missed calls on my cell.

He’s also called home twice. Kate has been very vague as to where I am. He’ll know she’s

covering for me. Kate doesn’t do vague. But I have decided to let him stew. I’m still too

angry with him.

Christian mentioned some kind of written paperwork, and I don’t know if he was jok-

ing or if I’m going to have to sign something. It’s so frustrating trying to guess. And on

top of all the angst, I can barely contain my excitement or my nerves. Tonight’s the night!

After all this time, am I ready for this? My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small

foot impatiently. She’s been ready for this for years, and she’s ready for anything with

Christian Grey, but I still don’t understand what he sees in me… mousey Ana Steele - it

makes no sense.

He is punctual, of course, and waiting for me when I leave Clayton’s. He climbs out

of the back of the Audi to open the door and smiles warmly at me.

“Good evening, Miss Steele,” he says.

“Mr. Grey.” I nod politely to him as I climb into the backseat of the car. Taylor is sit-

ting in the driver’s seat.

“Hello, Taylor,” I say.

“Good evening, Miss Steele,” his voice is polite and professional. Christian climbs in

the other side and clasps my hand, giving it a gentle squeeze that I feel all the way though

my body.

“How was work?” he asks.

“Very long,” I reply, and my voice is husky, too low, and full of need.

“Yes, it’s been a long day for me too.” His tone is serious.

“What did you do?” I manage.

“I went hiking with Elliot.” His thumb strokes my knuckles, back and forth, and my

heart skips a beat as my breathing accelerates. How does he do this to me? He’s only

touching a very small area of my body, and the hormones are flying.

The drive to the heliport is short and, before I know it, we arrive. I wonder where the

fabled helicopter might be. We’re in a built-up area of the city and even I know helicopters

need space to take off and land. Taylor parks, climbs out, and opens my car door. Christian

is beside me in an instant and takes my hand again.

“Ready?” he asks. I nod and want to say for anything, but I can’t articulate the words

as I’m too nervous, too excited.

“Taylor.” He nods curtly at his driver, and we head into the building, straight to a set

of elevators. Elevator! The memory of our kiss this morning comes back to haunt me.

I have thought of nothing else all day. Daydreaming at the register at Clayton’s. Twice

Mr. Clayton had to shout my name to bring me back to Earth. To say I’ve been distracted

would be the understatement of the year. Christian glances down at me, a slight smile on

his lips. Ha! He’s thinking about it too.

“It’s only three floors,” he says dryly, his gray eyes dancing with amusement. He’s

telepathic surely. It’s spooky.

I try to keep my face impassive as we enter the elevator. The doors close, and it’s there,

the weird electrical attraction crackling between us, enslaving me. I close my eyes in a

vain attempt to ignore it. He tightens his grip on my hand, and five seconds later the doors

open on to the roof of the building. And there it is, a white helicopter with the name Grey

Enterprises Holdings Inc. written in blue with the company logo on the side. Surely this is

misuse of Company property.

He leads me to a small office where an old timer sits behind the desk.

“Here’s your flight plan, Mr. Grey. All external checks are done. It’s ready and waiting

sir. You’re free to go.”

“Thank you, Joe.” Christian smiles warmly at him.

Oh. Someone deserving of the polite treatment from Christian, perhaps he’s not an

employee. I stare at the old guy in awe.

“Let’s go,” Christian says, and we make our way toward the helicopter. When we’re

up close, it’s much bigger than I thought. I expected it to be a roadster version for two,

but it has at least seven seats. Christian opens the door and directs me to one of the seats

at the very front.

“Sit – don’t touch anything,” he orders as he clambers in behind me.

He shuts the door with a slam. I’m glad that the area is floodlit, otherwise I’d find it

difficult to see inside the small cockpit. I sit down in my allotted seat, and he crouches

beside me to strap me into the harness. It’s a four-point harness with all the straps con-

necting to one central buckle. He tightens both of the upper straps, so I can hardly move.

He’s so close and intent on what he’s doing. If I could only lean forward, my nose would

be in his hair. He smells, clean, fresh, heavenly, but I’m fastened securely into my seat and

effectively immobile. He glances up and smiles, like he’s enjoying his usual private joke,

his gray eyes heated. He’s so tantalizingly close. I hold my breath as he pulls at one of the

upper straps.

“You’re secure, no escaping,” he whispers, his eyes are scorching. “Breathe, Anasta-

sia,” he adds softly. Reaching up, he caresses my cheek, running his long fingers down to

my chin which he grasps between his thumb and forefinger. He leans forward and plants

a brief, chaste kiss on my lips, leaving me reeling, my insides clenching at the thrilling,

unexpected touch of his lips.

“I like this harness,” he whispers.

What?

He sits down beside me and buckles himself into his seat, then begins a protracted pro-

cedure of checking gauges and flipping switches and buttons from the mind-boggling array

of dials and lights and switches in front of me. Little lights wink and flash from various

dials, and the whole of the instrument panel lights up.

“Put your cans on,” he says, pointing to a set of headphones in front of me. I pop them

on, and the rotor blades start. They are deafening. He puts his headphones on and contin-

ues flipping various switches.

“I’m just going through all the pre-flight checks.” Christian’s disembodied voice is in

my ears through the headphones. I turn and grin at him.

“Do you know what you are doing?” I ask. He turns and smiles at me.

“I’ve been a fully qualified pilot for four years, Anastasia, you’re safe with me.” He

gives me a wolfish grin. “Well, while we’re flying,” he adds and winks at me.

Winking… Christian!

“Are you ready?”

I nod wide eyed.

“Okay, tower. PDX this is Charlie Tango Golf – Golf Echo Hotel, cleared for take-off.

Please confirm, over.”

“Charlie Tango - you are clear. PDX to call, proceed to one four thousand, heading

zero one zero, over. ”

“Roger tower, Charlie Tango set, over and out. Here we go,” he adds to me, and the

helicopter rises slowly and smoothly into the air.

Portland disappears in front us as we head into US airspace, though my stomach re-

mains firmly in Oregon. Whoa! All the bright lights shrink until they are twinkling sweetly

below us. It’s like looking out from inside a fish bowl. Once we’re higher, there really is

nothing to see. It’s pitch black, not even the moon to shed any light on our journey. How

can he see where we’re going?

“Eerie isn’t it?” Christian’s voice is in my ears.

“How do you know you’re going the right way?”

“Here.” He points his long index finger at one of the gauges, and it shows an electronic

compass. “This is an EC135 Eurocopter. One of the safest in its class. It’s equipped for

night flight.” He glances and grins at me.

“There’s a helipad on top of the building I live in. That’s where we’re heading.”

Of course there’s a helipad where he lives. I am so out of my league here. His face

is softly illuminated by the lights on the instrument panel. He’s concentrating hard, and

he’s continually glancing at the various dials in front of him. I drink in his features from

beneath my lashes. He has a beautiful profile. Straight nose, square jawed – I’d like to

run my tongue along his jaw. He hasn’t shaved, and his stubble makes the prospect doubly

tempting. Hmm… I’d like to feel how rough it is beneath my tongue, my fingers, against

my face.

“When you fly at night, you fly blind. You have to trust the instrumentation,” he inter-

rupts my erotic reverie.

“How long will the flight be?” I manage breathlessly. I wasn’t thinking about sex at

all, no, no way.

“Less than an hour, the wind is in our favor.”

Hmm, less than an hour to Seattle… that’s not bad going, no wonder we’re flying.

I have less than an hour before the big reveal. All the muscles clench deep in my belly.

I have a serious case of butterflies. They are flourishing in my stomach. Holy shit, what

has he got in store for me?

“You okay, Anastasia?”

“Yes.” My answer is short, clipped, squeezed out through my nerves.

I think he smiles, but it’s difficult to tell in the darkness. Christian flicks yet another

switch.

“PDX this is Charlie Tango now at one four thousand, over.” He exchanges informa-

tion with air traffic control. It all sounds very professional to me. I think we’re moving

from Portland’s air space to Seattle International Airport’s.

“Understood Sea-Tac, standing by over and out.”

“Look, over there.” He points to a small pin-point of light in the far distance. “That’s

Seattle.”

“Do you always impress women this way? Come and fly in my helicopter?” I ask,

genuinely interested.

“I’ve never bought a girl up here, Anastasia. It’s another first for me.” His voice is

quiet, serious.

Oh, that was an unexpected answer. Another first? Oh the sleeping thing, perhaps?

“Are you impressed?”

“I’m awed, Christian.”

He smiles.

“Awed?” And for a brief moment, he’s his age again.

I nod.

“You’re just so… competent.”

“Why, thank you, Miss Steele,” he says politely. I think he’s pleased, but I’m not sure.

We ride into the dark night in silence for a while. The bright spot that is Seattle is

slowly getting bigger.

“Sea-Tac tower to Charlie Tango. Flight plan to Escala in place. Please proceed. And

standby. Over.”

“This is Charlie Tango, understood Sea-Tac. Standing by, over and out.”

“You obviously enjoy this,” I murmur.

“What?” He glances at me. He looks quizzical in the half-light of the instruments.

“Flying,” I reply.

“It requires control and concentration… how could I not love it? Though, my favorite

is soaring.”

“Soaring?”

“Yes. Gliding to the layperson. Gliders and helicopters – I fly them both.”

“Oh.” Expensive hobbies. I remember him telling me during the interview. I like read-

ing and occasionally going to the movies. I am out of my depth here.

“Charlie Tango come in please, over.” The disembodied voice of air traffic control

interrupts my reverie. Christian answers, sounding in control and confident.

Seattle is getting closer. We are on the very outskirts now. Wow! It looks absolutely

stunning. Seattle at night, from the sky…

“Looks good, doesn’t it?” Christian murmurs.

I nod enthusiastically. It looks otherworldly – unreal – and I feel like I’m on a giant

film set, José’s favorite film maybe, ‘Bladerunner.’ The memory of José’s attempted kiss

haunts me. I’m beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back. He can wait until tomor-

row… surely.

“We’ll be there in a few minutes,” Christian mutters, and suddenly my blood is pound-

ing in my ears as my heartbeat accelerates and adrenaline spikes through my system. He

starts talking to air traffic control again, but I am no longer listening. Oh my… I think I’m

going to faint. My fate is in his hands.

We are now flying amongst the buildings, and up ahead I can see a tall skyscraper with

a helipad on top. The word Escala is painted in white on top of the building. It’s getting

nearer and nearer, bigger and bigger… like my anxiety. God, I hope I don’t let him down.

He’ll find me lacking in some way. I wish I’d listened to Kate and borrowed one of her

dresses, but I like my black jeans, and I’m wearing a soft mint green shirt and Kate’s black

jacket. I look smart enough. I grip the edge of my seat tighter and tighter. I can do this. I

can do this. I chant this mantra as the skyscraper looms below us.

The helicopter slows and hovers, and Christian sets it down on the helipad on top of the

building. My heart is in my mouth. I can’t decide if it’s from nervous anticipation, relief

that we’ve arrived alive, or fear that I will fail in some way. He switches the ignition off

and the rotor blades slow and quiet until all I hear is the sound of my own erratic breathing.

Christian takes his headphones off, and reaches across and pulls mine off too.

“We’re here,” he says softly.

His look is so intense, half in shadow and half in the bright white light from the land-

ing lights. Dark knight and white knight, it’s a fitting metaphor for Christian. He looks

strained. His jaw is clenched and his eyes are tight. He unfastens his seatbelt and reaches

over to unbuckle mine. His face is inches from mine.

“You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. You know that don’t you?” His

tone is so earnest, desperate even, his gray eyes impassioned. He takes me by surprise.

“I’d never do anything I didn’t want to do, Christian.” And as I say the words, I don’t

quite feel their conviction because at this moment in time – I’d probably do anything for

this man seated beside me. But this does the trick. He’s mollified.

He eyes me warily for a moment and somehow, even though he’s so tall, he manages

to ease his way gracefully to the door of the helicopter and open it. He jumps out, waiting

for me to follow, and takes my hand as I clamber down on to the helipad. It’s very windy

on top of the building, and I’m nervous about the fact that I’m standing at least thirty stories

high in an unenclosed space. Christian wraps his arm around my waist, pulling me tightly

against him.

“Come,” he shouts above the noise of the wind. He drags me over to an elevator shaft

and, after tapping a number into a keypad, the doors open. It’s warm inside and all mir-

rored glass. I can see Christian to infinity everywhere I look, and the wonderful thing is,

he’s holding me to infinity too. Christian taps another code into the keypad, then the doors

close and the elevator descends.

Moments later, we’re in an all-white foyer. In the middle is a round, dark wood table,

and on it is an unbelievably huge bunch of white flowers. On the walls there are paintings,

everywhere. He opens two double doors, and the white theme continues through the wide

corridor and directly opposite where a palatial room opens up. It’s the main living area,

double height. Huge is too small a word for it. The far wall is glass and leads on to a bal-

cony that overlooks Seattle.

To the right is an imposing ‘U’ shaped sofa that could sit ten adults comfortably. It fac-

es a state-of-the-art stainless steel – or maybe platinum for all I know - modern fireplace.

The fire is lit and flaming gently. On the left beside us, by the entryway, is the kitchen area.

All white with dark wood worktops and a large breakfast bar which seats six.

Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by sixteen

chairs. And tucked in the corner is a full size, shiny black grand piano. Oh yes… he prob-

ably plays the piano too. There is art of all shapes and sizes on all the walls. In fact, this

apartment looks more like a gallery than a place to live.

“Can I take your jacket?” Christian asks. I shake my head. I’m still cold from the wind

on the helipad.

“Would you like a drink?” he asks. I blink at him. After last night! Is he trying to be

funny? For one second, I think about asking for a margarita – but I don’t have the nerve.

“I’m going to have a glass of white wine, would you like to join me?”

“Yes, please,” I murmur.

I am standing in this enormous room feeling out of place. I walk over to the glass wall,

and I realize that the lower half of the wall opens concertina-style on to the balcony. Se-

attle is lit up and lively in the background. I walk back to the kitchen area – it takes a few

seconds, it’s so far from the glass wall – and Christian is opening a bottle of wine. He’s

removed his jacket.

“Pouilly Fumé okay with you?”

“I know nothing about wine, Christian. I’m sure it will be fine.” My voice is soft and

hesitant. My heart is thumping. I want to run. This is seriously rich. Seriously over-the-

top Bill Gates style wealthy. What am I doing here? You know very well what you’re doing

here - my subconscious sneers at me. Yes, I want to be in Christian Grey’s bed.

“Here.” He hands me a glass of wine. Even the glasses are rich… heavy, contempo-

rary, crystal. I take a sip, and the wine is light, crisp, and delicious.

“You’re very quiet, and you’re not even blushing. In fact – I think this is the palest I’ve

ever seen you, Anastasia,” he murmurs. “Are you hungry?”

I shake my head. Not for food.

“It’s a very big place you have here.”

“Big?”

“Big.”

“It’s big,” he agrees, and his eyes glow with amusement. I take another sip of wine.

“Do you play?” I point my chin at the piano.

“Yes.”

“Well?”

“Yes.”

“Of course you do. Is there anything you can’t do well?”

“Yes… a few things.” He takes a sip of his wine. He doesn’t take his eyes off me. I feel

them following me as I turn and glance around this vast room. Room is the wrong word.

It’s not a room – it’s a mission statement.

“Do you want to sit?”

I nod, and he takes my hand and leads me to the large off-white couch. As I sit, I’m

struck by the fact that I feel like Tess Durbeyfield looking at the new house that belongs to

the notorious Alec D’Urberville. The thought makes me smile.

“What’s so amusing?” He sits down beside me, turning to face me. He rests his head

on his right hand, his elbow propped on the back of the couch.

“Why did you give me Tess of the D’Urbervilles specifically?” I ask. Christian stares

at me for a moment. I think he’s surprised by my question.

“Well, you said you liked Thomas Hardy.”

“Is that the only reason?” Even I can hear the disappointment in my voice. His mouth

presses into a hard line.

“It seemed appropriate. I could hold you to some impossibly high ideal like Angel

Clare or debase you completely like Alec D’Urberville,” he murmurs, and his gray eyes

flash dark and dangerous.

“If there are only two choices, I’ll take the debasement.” I whisper, gazing at him. My

subconscious is staring at me in awe. He gasps.

“Anastasia, stop biting your lip, please. It’s very distracting. You don’t know what

you’re saying.”

“That’s why I’m here.”

He frowns.

“Yes. Would you excuse me a moment?” He disappears through a wide doorway on

the far side of the room. He’s gone for a couple of minutes and returns with a document.

“This is a non-disclosure agreement.” He shrugs and has the grace to look a little em-

barrassed. “My lawyer insists on it.” He hands it to me. I’m completely bemused. “If

you’re going for option two, debasement, you’ll need to sign this.”

“And if I don’t want to sign anything?”

“Then it’s Angel Clare high ideals, well, for most of the book anyway.”

“What does this agreement mean?”

“It means you cannot disclose anything about us. Anything, to anyone.”

I stare at him in disbelief. Holy shit. It’s bad, really bad, and now I’m very curious to

know.

“Okay. I’ll sign.”

He hands me a pen.

“Aren’t you even going to read it?”

“No.”

He frowns.

“Anastasia, you should always read anything you sign,” he admonishes me.

“Christian, what you fail to understand is that I wouldn’t talk about us to anyone,

anyway. Even Kate. So it’s immaterial whether I sign an agreement or not. If it means so

much to you, or your lawyer… whom you obviously talk to, then fine. I’ll sign.”

He gazes down at me, and he nods gravely.

“Fair point well made, Miss Steele.”

I lavishly sign on the dotted line of both copies and hand one back to him. Folding the

other, I place it my purse and take a large swig of my wine. I’m sounding so much braver

than I’m actually feeling.

“Does this mean you’re going to make love to me tonight, Christian?” Holy shit. Did

I just say that? His mouth drops open slightly, but he recovers quickly.

“No, Anastasia it doesn’t. Firstly, I don’t make love. I fuck… hard. Secondly, there’s

a lot more paperwork to do, and thirdly, you don’t yet know what you’re in for. You could

still run for the hills. Come, I want to show you my playroom.”

My mouth drops open. Fuck hard! Holy shit, that sounds so… hot. But why are we

looking at a playroom? I am mystified.

“You want to play on your Xbox?” I ask. He laughs, loudly.

“No, Anastasia, no Xbox, no Playstation. Come.” He stands, holding out his hand. I let

him lead me back out to the corridor. On the right of the double doors, where we came in,

another door leads to a staircase. We go up to the second floor and turn right. Producing a

key from his pocket, he unlocks yet another door and takes a deep breath.

“You can leave anytime. The helicopter is on stand-by to take you whenever you want

to go, you can stay the night and go home in the morning. It’s fine whatever you decide.”

“Just open the damn door, Christian.”

He opens the door and stands back to let me in. I gaze at him once more. I so want to

know what’s in here. Taking a deep breath I walk in.

And it feels like I’ve time-traveled back to the sixteenth century and the Spanish In-

quisition.

Holy fuck.
